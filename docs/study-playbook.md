# Study session playbook

Use this 3-step loop whenever you open Study Spanish Coach. It keeps your practice balanced and ensures analytics stay meaningful.

## 1. Plan (2 minutes)
- Open the **Overview** and scan the quick actions. Note the streak, weakest tag, and due decks.
- Glance at the dashboard sparkline for recent activity, then pick one lesson or tag to emphasise.

## 2. Practise (15–25 minutes)
- Work through the recommended lesson first. Use the hint and rubric toggles sparingly and log every attempt.
- Keep the new session log open in the sidebar to spot timing and accuracy trends as you go.
- When you clear the lesson, pivot to the flashcard trainer. Filter by deck or tag to reinforce what you just studied and pick a session length that fits the time you have left.

## 3. Reflect (3 minutes)
- Return to the dashboard to confirm how the session changed your mastery and streak metrics.
- Add a short note to the changelog or your personal journal so you can compare future runs.

Repeat the loop daily and you’ll move from reactive cramming to deliberate progress.
