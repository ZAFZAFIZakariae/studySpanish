# Advanced Machine Learning — MLOps Implementation Clinics Cheat Paper

> Operational dossier for ADML-455 labs with English explanations and Spanish callouts.

## Clinic outline
- **Focus:** pipeline automation, monitoring, drift response, ethical deployment.
- **Deliverables:** runbooks, dashboards, executive briefs, bilingual glossaries.

## Pipeline setup & automation
- **Infrastructure checklist:** repositories, CI/CD pipelines, container registry, secrets vault. Document each step with English instructions and Spanish notes.
- **Experiment management:** configure MLflow tracking URI, experiment naming, artifact storage. Include screenshot references.
- **Automation tips:** Git hooks for linting, pipeline stages (build, test, deploy). Provide translation for key statuses (`Deployment succeeded / Despliegue exitoso`).
- **RACI table:** define responsibilities for data scientists, MLOps engineers, product owners, compliance officers.

## Monitoring & drift response
- **Metrics catalogue:** data drift, prediction drift, latency, cost. Provide formulas and thresholds.
- **Alerting:** set up Evidently dashboards, webhook notifications, Slack/Teams bilingual templates.
- **Incident playbook:** detection → triage → mitigation → post-mortem. Include bilingual incident log template.
- **Documentation:** maintain English incident reports with appended Spanish summaries for local teams.

## Ethical deployment playbook
- **Fairness checklist:** dataset audit, bias metrics, mitigation strategies. Translate each checklist item.
- **Privacy & compliance:** data retention, consent tracking, audit logs. Provide bilingual bullet points for board review.
- **Executive briefing:** 2-page English overview with Spanish executive summary; include KPIs (accuracy, drift rate, fairness score).
- **Control dashboard:** recommended widgets (model health, incidents, actions). Provide screenshot placeholders.

## Study practices
- Run the full runbook before each clinic session to confirm instructions remain accurate.
- Share dashboards with mentors for early feedback and note Spanish terminology they prefer.
- Convert tricky Spanish annotations into flashcards to reinforce vocabulary.

## Appendices
- **Appendix A:** runbook template with bilingual sections.
- **Appendix B:** incident log sample.
- **Appendix C:** ethical review checklist.
