# Gobierno de TI — Stakeholder Workshops Cheat Paper

> End-to-end facilitation blueprint with English direction and Spanish cues for GGO-205 workshop labs.

## Session overview
- **Activities covered:** Bedell method, stakeholder canvases, translation clinic, executive playback.
- **Purpose:** enable English delivery of workshops while preserving Spanish nuance for local stakeholders.
- **Preparation time:** 45 minutes setup, 90 minutes facilitation, 30 minutes follow-up.

## Workshop setup
- **Pre-work checklist:**
  - Confirm objectives, success metrics, agenda, logistics. Store them in English with Spanish footnotes.
  - Duplicate stakeholder canvas templates (Miro/PowerPoint) with bilingual headings.
  - Assign roles: facilitator, scribe, timekeeper, translator. Provide responsibilities in both languages.
- **Room layout:** U-shape for discussion, breakout tables for scoring, dedicated translation board.
- **Materials:** printed scorecards, sticky notes (colour-coded per stakeholder), bilingual timers, QR link to digital canvas.

## Execution scripts
- **Opening script (English primary):**
  1. Welcome and norms (share Spanish version on slide).
  2. Overview of Bedell method, emphasising the value impact scale.
  3. Clarify languages to be used (English discussion, Spanish sidebar notes accepted).
- **Bedell scoring:** explain factors (Contribution, Impact, Criticality). Provide example scoring in both languages.
- **Stakeholder alignment drill:** map influence vs. support, capture pain points, translate key phrases immediately.
- **Facilitation cues:** use the bilingual question bank to unblock silence (`What risk worries you most? / ¿Qué riesgo te preocupa más?`).

## Follow-up & translation clinic
- **Debrief circle:** 10-minute reflective round summarising insights in English, confirm Spanish accuracy.
- **Action log:** assign owners, due dates, next checkpoints. Include bilingual summary per action.
- **Translation clinic:**
  - Collect Spanish annotations that need polishing.
  - Use provided glossary table to harmonise terms.
  - Produce final bilingual stakeholder map and executive memo snippet.

## Study tips
- Role-play each section with classmates, rotating facilitation roles to build muscle memory.
- Time each agenda block to stay within schedule; adjust cues accordingly.
- Highlight difficult vocabulary during the clinic and add to your personal glossary.
