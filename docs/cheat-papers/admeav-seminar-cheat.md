# Advanced Machine Learning — Research Seminar Series Cheat Paper

> Comprehensive bilingual digest for ADML-401 seminar discussions.

## Seminar coverage
- **Themes:** Gaussian processes, Bayesian inference, continual learning, ethics & governance, research communication.
- **Artifacts included:** theorem summaries, debate prompts, vocabulary glossaries, note-taking templates.

## Gaussian processes & Bayesian inference
- **Key concepts:** kernel design, inducing points, constrained optimisation, sparse approximations. Translate keywords (`kernel`, `puntos inductores`, `restricciones`).
- **Derivation highlights:** posterior mean/variance formulas, covariance updates under constraints. Provide annotated example.
- **Discussion prompts:** trade-offs between exact inference and sparse methods, applications in real systems.
- **Takeaway summary:** bullet list of practical implications for deployment, with Spanish synopsis.

## Continual learning & ethics
- **Method families:** regularisation (EWC, SI), rehearsal (experience replay), architectural approaches (dynamic expansion). Provide bilingual explanation for each.
- **Evaluation:** metrics for forgetting (`Δ accuracy`), transfer, resource cost. Include translation of evaluation terms.
- **Ethical considerations:** fairness drift, transparency, human oversight. Provide question bank for panel sessions.
- **Debate prep:** sample arguments and counter-arguments with bilingual phrasing.

## Seminar facilitation toolkit
- **Agenda template:** intro, paper walkthrough, critique, open Q&A, wrap-up. Include time allocations.
- **Question bank:** clarifying, probing, reflective, closing questions with English/Spanish pairs.
- **Deliverables checklist:** summary note, vocabulary update, action items. Provide bilingual format.

## Study cycle
- Draft a one-page English brief after each paper, then translate the abstract and key insights into Spanish.
- Record unfamiliar vocabulary and add Spanish equivalents to the glossary.
- Rehearse debate contributions aloud; use the question bank to self-interrogate.

## Appendices
- **Appendix A:** glossary of advanced ML terminology.
- **Appendix B:** sample seminar summary template.
- **Appendix C:** ethics checklist for research discussions.
