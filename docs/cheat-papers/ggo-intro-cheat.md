# Gobierno de TI — Introducción al gobierno de TI Cheat Paper

> Executive-ready English briefing with Spanish clarifications for GGO-101. Ideal for preparing bilingual memos and oral defences.

## Course scope
- **Framework focus:** COBIT 2019, value delivery models, performance measurement, stakeholder alignment.
- **Deliverables supported:** executive memos, governance scorecards, stakeholder maps, translation glossaries.
- **How to use:** skim English summaries before meetings, consult Spanish callouts when adapting to local context.

## COBIT 2019 essentials
- **Principles & governance system:** outline the six COBIT principles and map them to the governance components (processes, organisational structures, information, culture/behaviour, people, services, infrastructure). Provide Spanish equivalents for each term.
- **Goals cascade:** document enterprise goals → alignment goals → governance/management objectives. Include KPI examples (ROI de TI, satisfacción del cliente) and note measurement cadence.
- **Design factors:** summarise drivers such as enterprise strategy, risk profile, compliance, and IT adoption strategy. Maintain bilingual glossary (e.g., `apetito de riesgo`, `IT-related goals`).

## Value delivery & performance toolkit
- **Benefit, risk, cost matrices:** capture evaluation criteria in English, annotate Spanish keywords for board discussions.
- **Balanced scorecard template:** financial, customer, internal, learning perspectives. Add bilingual KPI suggestions (e.g., *cycle time / tiempo de ciclo*).
- **Maturity & capability levels:** align with COBIT levels (0–5). Provide sample evidence for each level and translation cues.

## Stakeholder communication
- **Stakeholder map:** power vs. interest grid with English descriptors; attach Spanish explanation for each quadrant.
- **Engagement plan:** outline message frequency, medium, owner, call-to-action. Provide bilingual scripts for common touchpoints (steering committee, finance review).
