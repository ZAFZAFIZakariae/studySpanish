# Exam-day speaking checklist

Heading into an oral exam or live assessment? Run through this abbreviated list to stay calm and structured.

- **Warm up with a micro sprint.** Spend 5 minutes on due flashcards and one targeted lesson exercise so your brain is already in Spanish mode.
- **Review your anchor phrases.** Re-read the connectors and idioms you rely on for introductions, transitions, and conclusions.
- **Plan your structure.** Jot down a three-part outline (opening, development, wrap-up) before you start speaking.
- **Track time cues.** Set subtle timers or glances so you hit every section without rushing the finale.
- **Debrief immediately.** After the session, capture wins and fixes in the changelog so you can iterate before the next run.
