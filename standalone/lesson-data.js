      "Caso de Estudio",
      "XYZ ACO se formó en asociación entre el Hospital XYZ ACO y 10 grupos de proveedores que constan de aproximadamente 920 médicos, 630 especialistas independientes, farmacias y laboratorios. La misión de XYZ ACO es mejorar la calidad de los servicios de atención médica, incluidos los servicios de Medicare, y reducir el crecimiento de los gastos de atención médica. Su objetivo es lograr esto proporcionando servicios de atención coordinados de alta calidad e introducir economías de escala en la negociación de un contrato con todos los pagadores en nombre de todos los grupos de la empresa. Como parte de la visión estratégica de XYZ ACO, se formuló un nuevo enfoque para brindar atención médica de calidad mientras se administra la atención médica para pacientes privados en los EE. UU. La intención ha sido crear una organización de atención responsable utilizando un modelo novedoso de prestación de atención que cumpliría y se regiría por la Ley de Atención Médica Asequible de los Centros de Servicios de Medicare y Medicaid (CMS). La Ley del Cuidado de Salud a Bajo Precio incluye una serie de disposiciones diseñadas para: mejorar la calidad de los servicios de Medicare; apoyar la innovación y el establecimiento de nuevos modelos de pago en el programa; alinear mejor los pagos de Medicare con los costos del proveedor; fortalecer la integridad del programa dentro de Medicare; y poner a Medicare sobre una base financiera más sólida. Además de mejorar la calidad, las iniciativas de XYZ ACO buscan reducir la escalada de los gastos de atención médica. Se reconoce ampliamente que la trayectoria actual del gasto en atención médica de la nación es insostenible. Los beneficiarios de Medicare comparten la carga de los costos crecientes, ya que pagan primas más altas y mayores costos compartidos. El Grupo XYZ ACO ha estado operando de forma independiente durante tres años y, a pesar de un fuerte liderazgo, cada entidad comercial todavía se administra por separado y se contabiliza en balances y contratos de atención médica separados, lo que hace que la rentabilidad sea un desafío. Las preocupaciones de la organización incluyen:",

El alcance del proyecto estaba restringido y gobernado por los impulsores y preocupaciones comerciales como se define en la Declaración de trabajo de la arquitectura (consulte la Tabla 1). Se proporciona una lista completa de preocupaciones y principios en las Notas de casos de enseñanza, Tabla 2 (consulte las “Teaching notes” publicadas en Poliformat), junto con descripciones, fundamentos e implicaciones de cada uno. Los principios clave de la arquitectura de XYZ ACO se resumen en la siguiente lista:",
      "Principio 1: Mejorar la calidad de la atención y el acceso a la atención médica.",
      "Principio 2: Asequibilidad: reducir el costo de los servicios de salud.",
      "Principio 3: Proporcionar transparencia en la información entre las empresas participantes y las partes interesadas.",
      "Principio 4: El diseño debe promover la reutilización dentro y entre la cadena de hospitales XYZ.",
      "Principio 5: Proporcionar un equilibrio flexible en complejidad, manejabilidad y desempeño.",
      "Principio 6: Los componentes deben mantener una alta cohesión y un bajo acoplamiento.",
      "Principio 7: Alta seguridad de la información, los sistemas comerciales, los datos, las aplicaciones y la infraestructura.",
      " La iniciativa EA se implementará en varios lanzamientos de proyectos.",
      "La Versión 1 abordará la Capacidad de gestión del rendimiento del servicio para respaldar el Principio 1 y  3 anteriores y representa el alcance de la Descripción de la arquitectura, como se especifica en este estudio de caso. Además, los Principios 4 a 7 anteriores debían implementarse para todos los puntos de vista del desarrollo de la arquitectura.",
      "La Figura 2 es el Diagrama de contexto del sistema empresarial para XYZ ACO para la Versión 1. En el diagrama, los sistemas internos están coloreados en gris a la derecha, mientras que los sistemas externos e individuos (por ejemplo, Pacientes y Pagadores) se muestran a la izquierda coloreados en gris claro. XYZ ACO serviría como orquestador entre entidades internas y externas, con un componente de Integración de información empresarial (EII) que proporciona capacidades de integración de datos tanto interna como externamente. El componente EII se implementará parcialmente en la Versión 1 para respaldar la Gestión del rendimiento del servicio en las áreas de Gestión de citas de pacientes, Gestión del rendimiento del servicio y Gestión del calendario empresarial.",
      "Los lanzamientos futuros abordarán los principios del punto de vista de la arquitectura de los sistemas comerciales centrados en la Gestión de pagos centralizada utilizando un número de identificación de miembro único. La arquitectura de la aplicación para realizar las capacidades de Gestión del rendimiento del servicio debe abordar las inquietudes pertinentes para evaluar las funciones del médico de atención primaria / especialista y la calidad del servicio brindado a los pacientes tratados en los hospitales XYZ ACO. Esto incluye informar sobre sus horarios de trabajo diarios, semanales y mensuales, los procedimientos médicos realizados y la revisión de los pacientes de los servicios de atención médica recibidos durante las visitas y / o el tratamiento en los hospitales XYZ ACO. Para la Versión 1 se debe realizar un Análisis de Desempeño de la iniciativa en términos de Metas y Medidas en tres niveles, a saber, el Nivel de Organización (estratégico), el Nivel de Proceso (táctico) y el Nivel de Actividad (operativo), enfocándose en el Diseño y la Implementación, y Actividades de gestión para alcanzar las Metas y Medidas establecidas.",
      "La Tabla 2 es un resumen de este análisis y facilitó la alineación de la Planificación Estratégica de las tecnologías de la información con la estrategia empresarial, particularmente porque tiene relación con la nueva iniciativa XYZ ACO Health Care.

      "Empleados en su centro de trabajo.   MARIMAR JIMÉNEZ Madrid - 12 AGO 2022 - 07:39 CEST La pandemia por el Covid-19 aceleró la adopción de tecnología en las organizaciones de todo el mundo para impulsar su digitalización y adaptarse a las exigencias del momento, cuando se impuso el teletrabajo y las empresas necesitaban dar servicio a sus clientes de manera online. Ahora, un estudio de Telefónica Tech saca conclusiones sobre cómo se hizo esa apuesta tecnológica y qué ocurrirá a partir de ahora. Entre otras revela que el 57% de las empresas mundiales consultadas tienen previsto invertir más en TIC (tecnologías de la información y de las comunicaciones) en los próximos dos años y el 35% hacer lo mismo, aunque la falta de presupuesto es la principal limitación para cumplir con esta estrategia.",

      "El estudio, que recoge las respuestas de un total de 810 profesionales del sector TI de España, Brasil, Alemania, Reino Unido y la República de Irlanda, apunta que la mayoría de las organizaciones consultadas afirma que la pandemia ha acelerado su estrategia de TIC y se encuentran ahora en mejor posición que antes (60%), pero todavía hay un 28% que confiesa que solo se ocupan de las necesidades inmediatas. Igualmente destaca que el 81% de las empresas mundiales (el 72% en el caso español) reconoce haber hecho compras urgentes de TIC para adaptarse a las condiciones de la pandemia que no le aportarán valor estratégico a largo plazo. El estudio, titulado Sembrando semillas digitales para el futuro, expone que el 48% de las organizaciones consultadas (el 42% en España) adelantó los planes estratégicos de TIC (incluyendo la tecnología colaborativa y en la nube) para hacer frente a la pandemia. Por su parte, el 31% de las empresas cambió rápidamente su negocio y revisó sus TIC, el 17% analizó la tecnología que poseía y la utilizó de forma más eficaz, y solo el 2% de los encuestados reconoce no haber hecho ningún cambio. Más eficiencia Más de la mitad de las empresas encuestadas destacan igualmente como principal lección aprendida en la pandemia que la adaptación de las personas y los procesos a su estrategia tecnológica les generó importantes ganancias de eficiencia respecto a cómo lo hacían antes. Este resultado es más notorio en las empresas de sectores de biotecnología (80%), comercio minorista (76%), finanzas (72%), alimentación y bebidas (70%) y Administración pública (68%). Los encuestados subrayan también la importancia de contar con una mayor colaboración dentro de la empresa para tomar mejores decisiones en materia de TIC (47%). Este punto ha sido destacado especialmente por las empresas de los sectores de sanidad (72%), agricultura (69%) y energía (67%). Otro dato revelado es que el 31% de los participantes en el estudio (el 26% en el caso de España) dice haberse expuesto a posibles vulnerabilidades de seguridad por malas prácticas en el trabajo a distancia antes de la pandemia. El balance realizado por las empresas también apunta a que el 20% no estaba usando las herramientas que tenían a su alcance y a que el 15% había tomado malas decisiones en materia de TIC antes de la pandemia. Además, el 13% de los encuestados reconoce haberse dado cuenta de que no podían combinar los antiguos procesos con la nueva tecnología, sino que era necesario que el cambio se produjera a la vez. Según el estudio, la pandemia planteó varios retos importantes a los que las compañías deben enfrentarse actualmente. El 44% de ellas (el 45% en España) reconoce que, pese a haber mejorado su eficiencia tecnológica, necesita implantar procesos basados en las personas para, por ejemplo, analizar cómo se utiliza la tecnología, ver cómo compartir datos y trabajar juntos e involucrar a los empleados en las decisiones de cómo la empresa usa la tecnología para innovar de cara al crecimiento futuro.",

      "Otros retos que sortear Las empresas encuestadas plantean otros retos como la necesidad de contar con más formación para que los empleados puedan cumplir con las nuevas exigencias operativas (así lo afirma el 39% de ellas), el destinar tiempo para revisar y hacer balance sobre el estado del negocio para decidir los próximos pasos (el 35%) y el intentar hacer un mejor uso de los datos para obtener información estratégica (el 21% de los consultados). Las empresas se encuentran con algunas limitaciones significativas para alcanzar sus aspiraciones estratégicas en materia de TIC. Entre ellas destacan: la falta de presupuesto y de competencias internas (con un 41% y 32%, respectivamente), las limitaciones de los socios (30%) y la tecnología no probada y la elección de la estrategia (ambas con un 24%).",

      "                                            Scenario: Rollins Manufacturing -<br>Rollins Manufacturing is a major supplier in the automotive industry, headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio with manufacturing plants in Chicago, Sao Paulo, Stuttgart,<br>Yokohama, and Seoul. Each of these plants has been operating its own Manufacturing Requirements Planning (MRPII) system, production scheduling, and custom developed applications that drive the automated production equipment at each plant.<br>Rollins is implementing lean manufacturing principles to minimize waste and improve the efficiency of all of its production operations. During a recent exercise held for internal quality improvement, it was determined that a significant reduction in process waste could be achieved by replacing the current MRPII and scheduling systems with a common Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system located in the Cleveland data center. This central system would provide support to each of the plants replacing the functionality in the existing systems. It would also eliminate the need for full data centers at each of the plant facilities. A reduced number of IT staff could support the remaining applications. In some cases, a third-party contractor could provide those staff.<br>The Rollins Enterprise Architecture department has been operating for several years and has mature, well-developed architecture governance and development processes that are strongly based on TOGAF 9.At a recent meeting, the Architecture Review Board approved a Request for Architecture Work from the Chief<br>Engineer of Global Manufacturing Operations who is the project sponsor. The request covered the initial architectural investigations and the development of a comprehensive architecture to plan the transformation.<br>The Common ERP Deployment architecture project team has now been formed, and the project team has been asked to develop an Architecture Vision that will achieve the desired outcomes and benefits. Some of the plant managers have expressed concern about the security and reliability of driving their MRPII and production scheduling from a central system located in Cleveland. The Chief Engineer wants to know how these concerns can be addressed.<br>You are serving as the Lead Enterprise Architect for the Common ERP Deployment architecture project.<br>One of the earliest initiatives in the Enterprise Architecture program at Rollins was the definition of a set of IT principles and architecture principles that are well aligned with the overall enterprise principles. These now need to be updated to address the concerns raised.<br>You have been asked to select a set of principles most appropriate for guiding the team to define a robust solution.<br>[Note: You should assume that Rollins has adopted the example set of principles that are listed and defined in TOGAF 9, Section 23.6.]<br>Based on TOGAF 9, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",

      "                                            Scenario: Global Mobile 1 -<br>Global Mobile is a mobile telecommunications company formed through a series of mergers and acquisitions. They are yet to fully integrate the customer service systems for the most recent acquisitions, and as result, customer service has been a major concern for the Chief Technology Officer.<br>Results for the last two quarters have shown that Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and the customer retention (Churn) rate have fallen below the industry average. The Corporate Marketing group has published some new findings about customer satisfaction. The customers appear to be switching to Air Light, a competitor, because of superior customer service. Global Mobile actually has better coverage in nearly all markets than Air Light, and good roaming agreements that keep rates low for business travelers. But, customer satisfaction has remained low.<br>The Business Strategy group and the Enterprise Architecture group have conducted a high-level project to develop the enterprise-wide strategic plan. They have developed a business scenario which contains a good conceptual model of what needs to be done, and also identifies the key requirements. This was used in preparing the proposal presented to the Executive Council and the Corporate Board.<br>The planning for the program has been underway for several months. Global Mobile has selected TOGAF 9 as the basis for its Enterprise Architecture.<br>The Corporate Board has approved funding for a multi-million Euro conversion to transition to a packaged Customer Service System. It is anticipated that the overall program will take five years to complete, but there are some tactical projects that can commence immediately to address the situation. The Corporate<br>Board has placed one additional major constraint on the program. In addition to achieving the business outcomes directly related to improving overall customer service within each business unit, the Corporate Board expects the Target Architecture to produce an additional saving of at least 30% over current operating costs through energy efficiency initiatives, virtualization of servers and workstations, and expanded telecommuting and desk-sharing. This Green initiative is intended to become a model for future investments at all company facilities worldwide.<br>You have been engaged as a consultant to advise the Chief Architect on the best ways to approach to the implementation planning activities for this significant business transformation.<br>Based on TOGAF 9, which of the following is the best answer? (Is this the right answers to choose?)<br>",

      "                                            Scenario: AGEX Inc.<br>AGEX is a large, global commodities trading company which has been growing rapidly through a series of acquisitions.<br>Each new business is performing well in its markets. However, the lack of integration between headquarters and the business units has increasingly caused problems in the handling of customer and financial information. The inability to share information across businesses has resulted in lost opportunities to \"leverage the synergies\" that had been intended when the businesses were acquired. At present, each business unit maintains its own applications. Despite an earlier initiative to install a common application to manage customer, products, supplier, and inventory information, each business unit has different ways of defining each of these core elements and has customized the common application to the point where the ability to exchange information is difficult, costly, and error-prone.<br>As a result, AGEX has begun implementing a single Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system to consolidate information from several applications that exist across the lines of business. The Corporate Board is concerned that the new ERP system must be able to manage and safeguard customer information in a manner that meets or exceeds the legal requirements of the countries in which the company operates. This will be an increasingly important capability as the company expands its online services offered to clients and trading partners.<br>The CIO has formed an Enterprise Architecture department, and one of the primary goals in its charter is to coordinate efforts between the ERP implementation team and the business unit personnel who will be involved in the migration process. The CIO has also formed a cross-functional Architecture Review Board to oversee and govern the architecture.<br>After reviewing the available alternatives, and based on recommendations from the ERP vendor, AGEX has selected TOGAF 9 as the basis for its Enterprise<br>Architecture program.<br>The CIO has endorsed this choice with the full support of top management.<br>You are serving as the Chief Architect.<br>You have been asked to recommend the approach to take in the Preliminary Phase to ensure that the Corporate Board's concern is addressed.<br>Based on TOGAF 9, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",

Zephyr has manufacturing facilities located in Palm Springs, California, Omaha, Nebraska, and Winnipeg, Ontario. Each of these plants supplies a different manufacturer that builds and sells complete systems. The turbine blades are custom engineered to meet each manufacturers design specifications.<br>Until recently, most turbine blades were fabricated manually using molded fiber-reinforced plastics. However, recent improvements in composite materials, coupled with enhanced automated methods for precision application of materials during the molding process, have led to significant reduction in weight, increase in strength, and greatly improved blade longevity. Zephyr has pioneered the development of a proprietary automated process for continuous extrusion of the turbine blades. Patents have been filed to protect the process, but certain trade secrets must be closely guarded.<br>Zephyr has a mature Enterprise Architecture organization that is supported by a cross-functional Architecture Review Board. The Chief Information Officer and the<br>Chief Operating Officer co-sponsor the Enterprise Architecture program.<br>Zephyr has used TOGAF and its Architecture Development Method (ADM) to develop its automated manufacturing processes and systems that are used to design, manufacture, and test the blade assemblies. They have recently updated to TOGAF 9 and have adapted the Zephyr Enterprise Architecture to closely follow the TOGAF 9 framework. All of Zephyrs IT architects have been trained and certified on TOGAF 9.Recently, an architecture project was completed that defined a standard approach for controlling the Automated Test System that is used at each plant to perform final quality assurance tests on each completed blade assembly. The Manufacturing Architecture Board approved the plan for immediate implementation at each plant.<br>An Architecture Contract was developed that detailed the work needed to implement and deploy the new Automated Test System controller. The Chief Engineer, sponsor of the activity, has expressed concern that a uniform process be employed at each site to ensure consistency.<br>You are the Lead Architect for this activity.<br>You have been asked to recommend the best approach to adopt to address the Chief Engineer's concern.<br>Based on TOGAF 9, which of the following is the best answer?<br>",

      "characterized by five essential components, namely the",
      "architecture principles and concerns relevant for an EA",
      "initiative, the architecture meta-architecture framework, the",
      "architecture process model, the supporting architecture",
      "methodology, and the tool environment for developing the",

      "3.1 Meta-Architecture Framework",
      "The complexity of systems and processes of medium to large",
      "enterprises requires that IT systems not be viewed in",
      "isolation, but that all relevant factors and concerns be taken",
      "into consideration when developing architecture models. The",
      "meta-architecture framework is based on the interpretation of",
      "architecture, as the fundamental organization of a system",
      "embodied in its components, their relationships to each other,",
      "and to the environment, and the principles guiding the",
      "architecture design and evolution. The architecture design",
      "specifications are a blueprint of the policies, plans, processes,",
      "systems and stakeholders of the organization, and serve as a",
      "starting point for analysis, design, and decision making. The",

      "in the organizational structures, processes, and technologies",
      "that make up the organization, allowing opportunities for",
      "improvements in efficiency and strategy alignment to be",

      "analytical frame of reference to deal with the complexities",
      "when planning, developing and integrating the constituent",

      "embrace new technologies [1]. Businesses that excel  in",
      "seamlessly integrating cutting-edge technology into  their",
      "business models are poised to capture market share more",
      "rapidly than their competitors [2], [3]. Digital tr ansformation",
      "refers to the fundamental changes in how organizati ons or",
      "businesses use digital technology to alter the way they operate,",
      "interact with customers, and achieve their goals [4 ].",
      "Successful organizations in digital transformation are often",
      "more flexible in adopting changes and mastering new",
      "technologies. Additionally, they can collaborate with business",
      "partners or external parties to create more innovative solutions",

      "The idea management process is essentially based on",

      "However, the innovation management life cycle covers all the",

      "Therefore, the identification of the added value of the idea",
      "for its commercialization, in the form of a product, service, or",

      "value may lead to optimising a company's operations, but the",
      "solution itself has already been tested and validat ed in the",
      "market. However, when dealing with an innovative so lution,",
      "the value is uncertain and depends on multiple factors such as",
      "end-user acceptance, integration with existing syst ems, or",
      "stability within the organisation's system. Here, the difference",
      "between levels of innovation is fundamental for pro per",
      "acceptance, as a company may be innovating with exi sting",
      "technologies within its own context or introducing entirely",
      "new technologies for its sector, requiring different validation",

      "companies may find significant value in optimizing",
      "operational processes, while others may prioritize improving",
      "decision-making or enhancing adaptability to new",

      "To carry out this analysis, it is proposed to adapt  the",
      "Bedell's Method to identify the interest of the IT solution for",

      "processes that are impacted by the innovative IT solution?",
      "This dimension analyses the degree of relevance of the",
      "business processes impacted by the IT solution with in the",

      "structures the relationship between an organization  and its",
      "processes in the following hierarchy:",

      "structure is modified to address the IT solution from a sectoral",
      "perspective:",
      "Sector (1) → Subsectors (N) → Business process involved with the",
      "innovative IT solution (N)",

      "",
      "Organizational difficulties refer to internal obsta cles that",
      "may hinder the deployment of the solution within th e",
      "company. One of the main challenges is change management",
      "since the introduction of new technologies can gene rate",
      "resistance among employees and executives. The lack  of",
      "familiarity with the solution, fear of disruption to established",
      "processes, and uncertainty about its impact can slow down its",

      "clear communication and change management strategy that",
      "ensures the acceptance and commitment of all involv ed",
      "parties.",
      "Another important challenge is staff capability, as",
      "depending on the complexity of the solution, the company will",
      "need to invest in training to ensure that employees can use the",
      "new technology efficiently. Likewise, the implement ation of",
      "the solution could involve changes in the organizat ional",
      "structure, reassignment of responsibilities, or red efinition of",
      "key processes, which requires a detailed analysis to minimize",
      "negative impacts. Moreover, it is crucial that the solution is",
      "aligned with the company's strategic objectives. If  its",
      "implementation does not fit the business vision and  needs, it",
      "could create more obstacles than benefits.",
      "Finally, the decision-making process and acceptance  at",
      "different levels of the organization can pose a sig nificant",
      "challenge. This is due to the lack of consensus among different",
      "departments or uncertainty about the return on inve stment,",
      "which can delay implementation and affect the viability of the",

      "functioning. Security is another fundamental aspect  since",
      "incorporating new technology may increase the attack surface",
      "and expose the company to new risks. Nonetheless, solutions",
      "must comply with applicable security and privacy regulations,",
      "such as GDPR, and include strong protection measure s to",
      "prevent unauthorized access or data loss. Additiona lly, the",
      "performance and scalability of the solution must be considered",

      "XYZ ACO has developed a new approach to providing managed health care for private patients in the USA. XYZ ACO was",
      "formed by a partnership between XYZ Hospital, 10 Provider groups consisting of approximately 920 physicians,  630",
      "independent specialists, pharmacies, and laboratories. The intent is to create an accountable care organization with a new ca re",
      "delivery model which would comply with and be governed by the Affordable Care Act of the CMS. The Affordable Care Act",
      "includes a number of provisions designed to improve the quality of Medicare services, support innovation and the establishment",
      "of new payment models in the program, better align Medicare payments with provider costs, strengthen program integrity within",
      "Medicare, and put Medicare on a firmer financial footing. In addition to improving quality, ACO initiatives seek to reduce",
      "growth in health care expenditures. It is widely recognized that the current trajectory for the nation's health care spending  is",
      "unsustainable. Medicare beneficiaries share the burden of rising costs, as they pay higher premiums and larger cost -sharing",
      "obligations and out of- pocket expenses.",
      "The XYZ ACO group has now been operating independently for three years, with each entity still separate ly managed and",

      "• There is no total business architecture on which to base and manage operation of the group as a whole.",

      "Vanishing and Exploding Gradients",
      "Explanation:",
      "• RNNs process sequences step-by-step, using information from previous time steps to inform",
      "the current prediction.",
      "• During training, the gradients (used to update the model's weights) are propagated back",
      "through time. In long sequences, these gradients can either shrink exponentially (vanishing)",
      "or grow exponentially (exploding), making it difficult to learn long-range dependencies.",
      "Example:",
      "• Imagine trying to predict the last word in the sentence:",
      "• \"The cat, which was sitting on the mat in the sunny garden, ________.“",
      "• An RNN would struggle to remember the initial context (\"cat\") when reaching the end of the",
      "sentence, making it difficult to predict a word like \"purred\" or \"slept.“",
      "• The information about the cat might have \"vanished\" during backpropagation.",
      "• Conversely, in some cases, a minor change in the early part of the sequence could",
      "disproportionately affect the later predictions, a sign of exploding gradients.",

      "Sequential Processing",
      "Explanation:",
      "• RNNs process input sequentially, one word at a time.",
      "• his prevents parallelization, making them significantly slower than models that can process",
      "the entire sequence concurrently.",
      "Example:",
      "• Think of reading a book word by word versus being able to grasp the meaning of an entire",
      "page at once.",
      "• RNNs are like reading word by word, while Transformers are closer to grasping the whole",

      "Difficulty Capturing Long-Range Dependencies",
      "Explanation:",
      "• While LSTMs and GRUs were designed to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem to some",
      "extent through gating mechanisms, they still struggle to capture relationships between words",
      "that are far apart in a sequence.",
      "• The \"memory\" of these networks can fade over long distances.",

      "• Consider the sentence: \"The scientists, who had been working on the project for years, finally",
      "published their groundbreaking results.“",
      "• Understanding the connection between \"scientists\" and \"published\" requires retaining",

      "Contextual Understanding Limitations",
      "Explanation:",
      "• While LSTMs can consider some context, they primarily focus on the preceding sequence.",
      "• They don't capture the full bidirectional context (words both before and after) as effectively as",
      "Transformers.",
      "• RNNs and LSTMs traditionally relied on static word embeddings (like Word2Vec or GloVe), which",
      "assign a single vector representation to each word, regardless of its context. This creates problems",
      "with words that have multiple meanings (polysemy).",
      "Example:",
      "• The word \"bank\" can have different meanings depending on the surrounding words:",
      "• \"I sat on the bank of the river.“",
      "• \"I went to the bank to deposit money.“",
      "• While LSTMs can use the preceding words to disambiguate to some extent, they miss out on the",
      "information provided by the words following \"bank.\".",
      "• There is not bidirectionality in RNN/LSTM  (Transformers have bidirectionality)",
