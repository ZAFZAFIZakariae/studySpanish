        "\n",
        "Local Binary Patterns (LBP) is a texture descriptor used in image processing and computer vision for analyzing patterns or textures within an image. It works by comparing each pixel with its surrounding neighbors and encoding this local relationship as a binary number, which is then converted into a decimal value. This value serves as a feature that describes the texture in the local region of the image.\n",
        "LBP was first described in 1994 by Ojala et al.[1]\n",
