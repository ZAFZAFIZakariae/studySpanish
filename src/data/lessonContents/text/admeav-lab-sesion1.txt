# Lab scope
- Launch the notebook **Sesion1_FeatureExtraction_student.ipynb** and run the setup cells to install `scikit-image`, `opencv-python`, and plotting helpers.
- Document every preprocessing choice in a Markdown cell so you can compare pipelines during the retrospective.

## Part A · Edge and texture baselines
- Load the starter dataset and compute Sobel and Canny edges, noting how kernel sizes affect noise sensitivity.
- Extract Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features with `skimage.feature.graycomatrix`; log contrast, energy, and homogeneity values.

## Part B · Key descriptors (descriptores clave)
- Implement Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) blocks; capture both the Spanish term (**Patrones Binarios Locales**) and the English explanation.
- Compare descriptor dimensionality and runtime in a small table inside the notebook.

## Part C · Classification drill
- Train a simple SVM classifier using the extracted features and record accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Discuss overfitting risks and list hyperparameters that require tuning in the follow-up lab.

## Submission checklist
- Export the executed notebook with all outputs visible.
- Attach a short reflection (5 sentences) highlighting which descriptor balances performance and compute cost.
- Upload any custom helper scripts referenced in the notebook.
