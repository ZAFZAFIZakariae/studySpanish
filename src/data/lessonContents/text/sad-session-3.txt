Cloud Deployment and Service ModelsServicios y Aplicaciones Distribuidas

Cloud Computing Recap
•Shared pool of compute, storage, networking on demand.•On-demand self-service, broad access, elasticity.•Measured service: pay for what you use.

Why Service Models Matter
•They define the abstraction level you consume.•Control vs convenience trade-off changes per model.•Impacts agility, cost, and who is responsible for what.

IaaS: Definition & Scope
•Virtualized compute, storage, networking primitives.•You manage OS, runtime, middleware, data, apps.•Examples: EC2, Azure VMs, Google Compute Engine.

IaaS: Benefits and Challenges
•Benefits: flexibility, compatibility, fine-grained control.•Challenges: patching, capacity planning, more ops toil.•Mitigation: golden images, IaC, autoscaling groups.

PaaS: Definition & Scope
•Deploy code; platform manages runtime, scaling, and OS.•Opinionated buildpacks and service bindings.•Examples: Heroku, Azure App Service, AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

PaaS: Benefits and Challenges
•Benefits: faster delivery, less undifferentiated heavy lifting.•Challenges: platform constraints, vendor features vary.•Mitigation: 12-factor practices, clear SLOs, platform guardrails.

SaaS: Definition & Scope
•Complete application delivered as a service.•Provider manages everything; you configure and consume.•Examples: Gmail, Salesforce, GitHub, Slack.

SaaS: Benefits and Challenges
•Benefits: fastest time to value, minimal ops burden.•Challenges: customization limits, data/control constraints.•Mitigation: evaluate APIs, export paths, compliance posture.

IaaS vs PaaS vs SaaS (Responsibilities)•IaaS: you manage OS → app; provider manages hardware.•PaaS: you manage code & data; provider manages runtime & OS.•SaaS: you manage config & users; provider runs the app.

Choosing the Right Model
•Drivers: time-to-market, control needs, compliance, skills.•Workload traits: variability, latency needs, statefulness.•Evolve per service—mixed models across a portfolio.

Cloud Providers Overview
•Major hyperscalers: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud.•All offer IaaS/PaaS/SaaS building blocks.•Differ in strengths, ecosystem, and pricing models.

AWS: Strengths & Focus Areas
•Breadth/depth of services; rich ecosystem.•Mature IaaS (EC2, VPC), serverless (Lambda), data (S3).•Marketplace, partners, and global footprint.

Azure: Strengths & Focus Areas
•Enterprise integration with Microsoft stack.•Hybrid tooling (Azure Arc), strong identity (Entra ID/AAD).•Windows/.NET first-class, growing Linux/K8s support.

Google Cloud: Strengths & Focus Areas
•Data, analytics, and ML leadership (BigQuery, Vertex AI).•Innovations in containers and SRE practices.•High-performance networking.

Multi-Cloud and Portability
•Reasons: resilience, data locality, negotiation leverage.•Costs: duplicated ops, lowest-common-denominator designs.•Pragmatic approach: portable apps; non-portable data/analytics.

Public Cloud: Definition & Benefits
•Shared infrastructure operated by a provider.•Elasticity, global reach, rapid innovation.•Lower upfront capex; pay-as-you-go.

Public Cloud: Risks & Trade-Offs
•Shared tenancy and noisy-neighbor effects.•Potential egress and premium managed-service costs.•Compliance and data residency constraints.

Private Cloud: Definition & Benefits
•Dedicated infrastructure for one organization.•Control, customization, and data locality.•Predictable performance and governance.

Private Cloud: Risks & Trade-Offs
•Higher capex and ops burden vs public cloud.•Slower access to new managed services.•Risk of under/over-provisioning capacity.

Hybrid Cloud: Definition & Benefits
•Combine public and private across one architecture.•Burst capacity and place workloads where they fit.•Data gravity respected; latency-sensitive parts stay close.

Hybrid Cloud: Risks & Trade-Offs
•Complex networking, identity, and policy management.•Operational duplication across environments.•Hidden latency and failure modes across links.

Community Cloud (Brief)
•Shared by organizations with common concerns.•Often compliance-driven (sector-specific).•Niche, but relevant in regulated domains.

Use Case: Web Applications
•Stateless tiers fit PaaS/serverless; databases managed.•CDN, WAF, and auto-scaling patterns are common.•Blue-green/canary releases reduce risk.

Use Case: Big Data & Analytics
•Object storage as data lake; serverless query engines.•Batch and streaming pipelines (managed services).•Governance: catalogs, lineage, access controls.

Use Case: AI/ML Workloads
•Managed notebooks, training, and inference endpoints.•Access to accelerators (GPUs/TPUs) on demand.•Feature stores and MLOps pipelines.

Use Case: Backup & DR
•Cross-region replication and immutable backups.•Tiered storage classes to optimize cost.•Test restores and document RTO/RPO.

Cloud Cost Models
•On-demand, reserved/committed use, and spot/preemptible.•Per-request/serverless pricing vs provisioned capacity.•Data egress and managed service premiums matter.

FinOps Basics
•Visibility: tagging, allocation, showback/chargeback.•Optimization: rightsizing, autoscaling, schedules.•Governance: budgets, alerts, guardrails.

Shared Responsibility Model
•Provider secures the cloud; you secure what you run.•Responsibility shifts by service model (IaaS→SaaS).•Document controls: identity, network, data, app.

Compliance & Data Residency
•Regions and availability zones influence data location.•Certifications (ISO, SOC) ≠ compliance out-of-the-box.•Design for audits: logging, retention, access reviews.

Vendor Lock-In & Portability
•Managed services speed delivery but deepen coupling.•Containers and open standards improve portability.•Make exit plans: backups, data export formats.

Key Takeaways
•Pick the right abstraction per workload (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS).•Public, private, and hybrid each trade control vs agility.•Governance, cost, and security must be intentional.

Closing & Next Session
•Next: Synchronous vs Asynchronous Communication.•Prepare: API examples, messaging fundamentals.•Q&A and reading list.
