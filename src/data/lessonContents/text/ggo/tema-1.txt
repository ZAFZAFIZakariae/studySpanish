# Topic 1 · Introduction to IT Governance (Gobierno de TI)

## Objectives (Objetivos)
- Understand the concept of governance (gobierno) and how organizations apply it.
- Distinguish between corporate governance (gobierno corporativo) and IT governance (gobierno de TI).
- Identify the key actors (actores clave) and their responsibilities.
- Recognize reference frameworks (marcos de referencia) that support IT governance roll-outs.

## Overview (Panorama general)
- **Governance (gobierno)** sets expectations, defines accountability, and oversees performance (OECD, Allen, Mueller).
- **Corporate governance (gobierno corporativo)** connects owners, the board, and executive management to maximize value and manage risk.
- The **CIO (director de TI)** must take part in those forums to align IT with the business strategy.

## IT Governance (Gobierno de TI)
- Extends corporate governance principles to the use of technology.
- Goal: ensure IT investments generate value (valor) and that technology risks (riesgos tecnológicos) are controlled.
- Key questions from the IT Governance Institute (ITGI):
  - Is IT aligned with the business (negocio)?
  - Are promised benefits (beneficios) being delivered?
  - Are IT risks (riesgos TI) being managed?
  - Are resources and performance (recursos y rendimiento) optimized?

## Core components (Componentes principales)
- **Strategic alignment (Alineación estratégica):** IT supports business objectives.
- **Value delivery (Entrega de valor):** benefits are measured and the portfolio is prioritized.
- **Resource management (Gestión de recursos):** talent, infrastructure, and services are stewarded.
- **Risk management (Gestión de riesgos):** continuity, security, and compliance stay under control.
- **Performance measurement (Medición del desempeño):** dashboards and indicators track outcomes.
