# Stakeholder template briefing
- Open **“Análisis de stakeholders 2024”** and duplicate the sheet so you can preserve the Spanish labels while drafting English notes.
- Start with a one-sentence summary of the business initiative, referencing the strategic driver (**impulsor estratégico**) from Topic 3.

## Quadrant setup (configuración de cuadrantes)
- Use the matrix axes Power (**poder**) and Interest (**interés**) to classify each stakeholder; document the rationale in English and repeat the key Spanish term used in the PDF.
- If a stakeholder shifts quadrant, log the trigger event (**evento detonante**) in English followed by the Spanish phrase.

## Messaging cues (mensajes clave)
- For every quadrant, capture a bilingual communication goal, e.g. “Keep satisfied (**mantener satisfecho**) by sharing KPI dashboards monthly.”
- Note the preferred channel (**canal preferido**) in English with the Spanish label from the template in parentheses.

## Engagement actions (acciones de involucramiento)
- Translate the recommended action verbs into English while keeping the Spanish verbs for authenticity, such as “Co-create (**cocrear**) a release roadmap.”
- Add deadlines or cadences (frecuencias) in ISO format so they integrate with the planner view.

## Artefacts to submit
- Completed stakeholder matrix exported to PDF with bilingual notes.
- Short risk log listing stakeholders with low support (**apoyo bajo**) and your mitigation plan in English.
- Meeting agenda draft that names each attendee in Spanish and clarifies their English role title.
