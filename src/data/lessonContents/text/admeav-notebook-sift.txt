# Notebook objectives
- Implement the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (**Transformada de Características Invariantes a la Escala**) pipeline step by step.
- Evaluate matching quality on image pairs with viewpoint and illumination changes.

## Guided steps
1. Import OpenCV and load the provided sample pair; convert to grayscale.
2. Detect keypoints with `cv2.SIFT_create()` and annotate the visualisation, keeping the Spanish name **puntos clave** alongside the English caption.
3. Compute descriptors, then use a Brute-Force matcher with ratio test; explain each threshold in English while echoing the Spanish term **coeficiente de Lowe**.
4. Estimate a homography to align the images and discuss failure cases when matches are sparse.

## Reflection prompts
- Which preprocessing steps improved keypoint stability? Mention Spanish vocabulary for blur (**desenfoque**) or histogram equalisation (**ecualización de histograma**).
- How many good matches are required for a reliable transformation in your dataset?

## Deliverables
- Notebook with executed cells and saved figures demonstrating matches before and after filtering.
- Brief analysis (5-7 sentences) comparing SIFT to the descriptors from Session 1.
- Optional: CSV export listing keypoint coordinates for downstream experiments.
