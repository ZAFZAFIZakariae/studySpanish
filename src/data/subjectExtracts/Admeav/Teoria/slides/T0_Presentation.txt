Theoretical class structure
• The theory classes will be
accompanied by a notebook
in Python (Google Collab).
• Starting from the next
session, it is essential that
you all bring your computers
with a Google Collab
account.

Assesment

The assessment of the content will consist of two parts:
- Participation and performance in lab sessions (20% of the mark). They
will be assessed through the work done in the laboratory class.
- Theoretical-practical contents (40% of the mark). They will be evaluated
through two written tests, each accounting for 20% of the mark, one in the
middle of the semester and another at the end.
- Evaluation of the work (40% of the mark): the code presented (20%) and
an oral presentation of the same (20%) will be evaluated. The work may be
recovered by improving it as necessary in order to pass the evaluation.
The final mark of the course, for all students, will be the maximum between the
ordinary evaluation and the recovery.
