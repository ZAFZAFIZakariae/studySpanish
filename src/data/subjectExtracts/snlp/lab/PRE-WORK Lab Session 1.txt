LABORATORY SESSION 1
Spoken Digit Recognition

Work to do before the day of the session

Objective: Record audio samples of spoken digits (0-9) for use in a digit recognition
experiment.
Requirements:
1. Equipment:
o Microphone (laptop built-in, headset, pro or mobile phone)
o Better if you try different mics during the recording (not mandatory)
o Audio recording software (Audacity recommended:
https://www.audacityteam.org/). Others you already know welcome.
2. Recording:
o Record each digit (0-9) at least 3 times
o Minimum 30 audio files in total
3. Audio specifications:
o File format: WAV
o Bit depth: Minimum 16-bit
o Sample rate: 48 kHz (will be standardized to a lower one later)
4. File naming convention: D_surname_T.wav    Where:
o D: Digit (0-9)
o surname: Your last name
o T: Attempt number (1-3)
o Example: 5_lopez_2.wav    (digit 5, surname Lopez, 2nd attempt)
5. Audio editing:
o Trim silence from the beginning and end of each recording
o Ensure only the spoken digit remains in the audio file

Steps:
1. Set up your recording equipment and software
2. For each digit (0-9):
a) Record the digit clearly
b) Trim silence from the beginning and end
c) Save the file using the naming convention
d) Repeat at least 3 times
3. Verify you have at least 30 properly named and edited audio files
Tips:
• Speak clearly and at a consistent volume
• Maintain a consistent distance from the microphone
• Record in a quiet environment to minimize background noise
• Use Audacity or any familiar audio editing software for recording and trimming

Submission: Upload all your audio files before the next lab session in a repository to be
announced.
If you have any questions or issues with the recording process, please contact your
professor for assistance.
