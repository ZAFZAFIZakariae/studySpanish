Sentiment Analysis

Objective:
• Do a practical Sentiment Analysis classification in Python.
• Using example code
• Modifying example code to improve it
Three proposals are offered from which you have to select one.
Upload your results (code & accurary) and a small explanation of your work to “PoliformaT
/ Espacio”


1. Fine Food Reviews from Amazon
There is a database of Fine Food Reviews in Kaggle.
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews
Download and put in your Google Drive for using Colab.

Starting example code
https://github.com/Storiesbyharshit/Natural-Language-Processing/blob/master/NLP-
Tensorflow-Fine-Food-Dataset/amazon-fine-food-reviews.ipynb
Modify the loading lines to load from your Google Drive

Qualification is from 1 to 5
For simplifying in the example 1,2,3 is BAD and 4,5 is GOOD

First run the example and obtain results
Next try to improve the network topology, hyperparam, or other things to improve results
And much better if you add another class:   BAD, MEDIUM, EXCELENT
