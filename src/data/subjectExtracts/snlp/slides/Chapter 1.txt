Revised Approach to Official Syllabus
The oficial syllabus is a list of contents, the order of topic study may not
follow the listed order in the official program, as we'll adapt to best
support your learning.
Be prepared for a dynamic and application-driven approach to NLP and
a more practical, hands-on learning experience.
Bring your laptop to classroom and try continuously.

Key Changes and Principles
1. Flexibility:
1. Official syllabus serves as a guideline
2. Content and order may be adjusted for improved pedagogy
2. Non-chronological Official Program:
1. The official program lists content topics, not a strict chronological order
2. Topics will be covered in an order that best supports practical learning
3. Coordination with Other Courses:
1. LSTM section streamlined (leveraging prior knowledge from “IA image” course)
2. Focus on application rather than re-explanation
4. Practical Focus:
1. Emphasis on hands-on, applied learning
2. Earlier introduction of practical applications
5. Dynamic Progression:
1. Course will advance alongside practical applications
2. Order of topics may be altered to facilitate this approach
6. Learning Objectives:
1. Prioritize practical, applicable skills in NLP
2. Ensure students can implement and use NLP techniques effectively

Signals Processing
• Sound and Audio Signals
How to process and analyze various types of audio signals, including environmental
sounds, complex audio scenes, industrial signals. Techniques to extract meaningful
features from raw audio data, enabling machines to understand and classify different
sound types.
• Speech Processing and Recognition
Delve into the specifics of speech signal processing, focusing on the extraction of
features. Understand how to build and train deep learning models for automatic
speech recognition (ASR) to convert spoken language into written text and explore
applications like voice-controlled systems and transcription services.
• Music Analysis & Synthesis
Discover how deep learning can be used for music genre classification, beat tracking,
and music recommendation systems. This involves feature extraction techniques that
capture the rhythm, harmony, and timbre of music. Also, music generation.

Natural Language Processing
Processing Language
Explore the processing of written language starting from its most basic representation:
ASCII text. Understand the challenges of converting raw text into numerical formats that
can be fed into neural networks. Techniques such as tokenization, embedding (e.g.,
Word2Vec), and sequence modeling with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and
Transformers will be covered.
Language Understanding and Generation:
Learn how to apply deep learning models to tasks like sentiment analysis, machine
translation, and text generation. This includes understanding the syntactic and semantic
aspects of language and building models that can understand and generate coherent
text.
