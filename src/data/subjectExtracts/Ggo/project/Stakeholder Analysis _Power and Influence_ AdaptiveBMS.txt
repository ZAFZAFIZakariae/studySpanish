### Sheet: Charts
 Interest/Power Plot:
The reference line represents the ideal balance for a vital stakeholder. Points above the line represent stakeholders with potentially high influence on the success of the project; they can either be powerful supporters or powerful detractors.
 Attitude/Activity Plot:
The reference line on the left marks the point at which stakeholders are considered potentially adversarial to the project. The reference line on the right marks the point at which stakeholders are considered potentially supportive of the project.

### Sheet: Notes
 Stake Holder Analysis
 Quantify the impact of the various stakeholders on a project, task or mission:

-Who are the key supporters?
-Who are the key opponents?

 Purpose
 Identify the key supporters that can help advance the project so you can keep them informed and develop their support
 Identify the key opponents that could negatively affect the project so you can address their needs/objections correctly
 Data
 List of stakeholders with the following attributes numerically evaluated:
 Attitude towards the project:
-(-10 = strongly against to +10 = strongly for)
 Activity relative to the project:
-(0 = completely passive to 10 = strongly active)
 Power within the organization to affect the project:
-(0 = no effective power to 10 = powerful influence)
 Interest in the project:
-(0 = no interest to 10 = very interested)
 Apply a code to each name for graphing purposes.
 Process
 Using a small team, evaluate and record the attitude, activity, power, and interest for each stakeholder.
 Evaluate the two plots to determine the status of each stakeholder.
 Caution:
 This tool is seen as Machiavellian by some people. So do use plenty of empathy when using this tool.
When you use it properly, the identification of Key Opponents can help you identify and address their concerns sufficiently to let the project proceed smoothly.
Do change the rankings as people change there attitudes. Out-of-date Stakeholder analysis forms can cause a lot of damage too.
