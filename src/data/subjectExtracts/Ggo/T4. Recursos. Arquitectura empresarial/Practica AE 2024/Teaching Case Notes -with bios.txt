ABSTRACT

These Teaching Case Notes are intended to accompany the Teaching Case paper with the same title. It contains models
developed by the project team. A selection of models developed by team members for the respective viewpoints, namely
Enterprise, Information Business Systems, Data, Application and Enterprise Security Viewpoints.


1. INTRODUCTION

The Teaching Case Notes provided here are in support of the
Teaching Case Study on Enterprise Architecture Specification
paper by the authors and the team project sponsor. A selection
of the models developed by team members for the respective
viewpoints are presented in the sections below.

2. ARCHITECTURE MODELS

Architecture models were developed for the enterprise,
information, business systems, data, application  and
enterprise security viewpoints. The models are summarized
per viewpoint in the sub -sections below. The populated
Architecture Framework is given in Table 1 to facilitate
referencing in the Teaching Case paper (TC paper) and these
Teaching Case Notes ( TC Notes).  The partial architecture
framework (first three columns) are given in the TC paper,
Table 5. The model portfolio was developed during the
Information/ Business Systems Architecture stages for the
viewpoints (Enterprise, Information, Business Systems, Data,
Application and Enterprise Security) that were addressed by
the project team. Models included are stated in bold type.
Table 2 lists the XYZ ACO Concerns and Principles
addressed by the team, arranged per architecture viewpoint.
Cross-referencing among viewpoints is given where relevant.
The core principles and concerns of the Business Systems
Architecture viewpoint will be implemented over several
stages of the architecture development cycle, with selected
concerns of Business Performance Mana gement, being
targeted for Release 1 (see Teaching Case, Section 1.1 Scope
of Architecture).

2.1 Enterprise Viewpoint Models
A selection of supplementary models to those given in the
Teaching Case Paper, developed by the team, is included in
this section for the Enterprise Viewpoint. The Enterprise
Viewpoint  focuses on the  and overarching concerns and
principles of the business, and includes the business strategy,
the XYZ ACO value chains, and the XYZ ACO EA as
interpreted by the team in the form of a conceptual model at
the start of the project.
Business Strategy.  Table 3 presents a synopsis of the
XYZ ACO Business Strategy and some corporate concerns.
The Value Chain Model . Figure 1 shows the primary
and support activities for XYZ ACO to achieve patient value.
Transparency and share -ability of data and information
according to authorizations of use are concerns.
Enterprise Architecture Model. The As-Is EA diagram
in Figure 2  shows a conceptualization of the XYZ ACO assets
in a layered model. The current EA cannot deliver XYZ ACO
services, due in part to the disparate systems utilized by
separate contracts, manage ment, and accounting involved in
the XYZ ACO enterprise systems.

OVERARCHING ENTERPRISE VIEWPOINT
PRINCIPLE/
CONCERN
DEFINITION
Quality   XYZ ACO Group Quality Care
 Statement Enterprise should provide excellence in care through its coordinated care services.
 Rationale Strategic Business Vision is to have an accountable health care organization providing coordinated
excellence in health care services.
 Implications Health care services provided by all stakeholders must be of consistent quality throughout the enterprise;
Requires that a systematic enterprise architecture be developed adhering to all the stated principles
 Affordability  Affordable Health Care Services
 Statement Health Care Services should be affordable for the membership
 Rationale Strategic Business Vision
 Implications Costs should be contained by all stakeholders throughout the Group; sustainable health care spending;
comply with Affordable Healthcare Act of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
 Accountability Accountable Health Care Services
 Statement XYZ ACO aims to manage healthcare costs through accountability by all stakeholders
 Rationale Strategic Business Vision
 Implications All stakeholders must be accountable for their services and behavior and healthcare must be managed;
confidentiality if patients must be maintained
Ease of Use Applications easy to use (also Application Viewpoint)
 Statement Software Systems and User Interfaces must be easy to use
 Rationale Complexity must be reduced to avoid mistakes
 Implications Flexibility and ease of use must be balanced in terms of complexity, manageability and performance for
applications.
Transparency Information Transparency and Visibility (also security views and enterprise security viewpoint)
 Statement Data and information must be transparent to stakeholders
 Rationale Data and information must be transparent (visible) to the users based on need to know and responsibility
 Implications Authorizations must be given and authentication performed on all classes of users of the systems
INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE VIEWPOINT
  Accessibility  Maximize accessibility of information (also Data Viewpoint)
  Statement Purpose of information management is to make information maximally accessible, visible and
transparent to the Enterprise as a whole.
  Rationale Principle represents “Information as a Service”, and stakeholders of XYZ ACO businesses must have
access to pertinent information.
  Implications A common set of policies, procedures, and standards governing information management and access for
both the short and the long term must be established and developed. For maximum enterprise-wide
benefit information accessibility must be implemented and managed in all systems
Information
Security
Information is secure within XYZ ACO (also Data and Enterprise Security Viewpoints)
  Statement Information is protected from unauthorized use, access, disruption, modification, perusal, inspection,
recording and disclosure. In addition to the traditional aspects of information systems, this includes, but
is not limited to, information protection of confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and availability.
  Rationale Open sharing of information and release of information throughout the enterprise, compliant with
relevant legislations must be balanced with the need to restrict the availability of classified, proprietary,
permitted, professional, and sensitive information. Current laws and regulations require the safeguarding
of information security and privacy of data. Pre-decisional (work-in-process, not yet authorized for
release) information must be well protected to avoid unwarranted speculation, misinterpretation, and
inappropriate use.
  Implications Access to information must be based on a need-to-know policy, and permissions granted on a need to
know basis. All viewpoints must consider implications of information security.
Information security safeguard must be implemented to restrict access to level of granted authorizations,
such as “view only”, or “never see”. XYZ ACO requires a policy on managing during of protection for
pre-decisional information and other works-in-progress.
![Page 6, Figure 1](../../public/subject-assets/Ggo/T4. Recursos. Arquitectura empresarial/Practica AE 2024/Teaching Case Notes -with bios/Teaching Case Notes -with bios_page_006.png)

### Page 7
Shareability Information is shared in XYZ ACO business environment (also Data and Security viewpoints).
  Statement Stakeholders have access to the information necessary to assist medical personnel and patients.
Therefore, information must be shared across the entire enterprise functions and organizations.
  Rationale It is cost-effective to maintain accurate information in a single location instead of maintaining
duplicative information in multiple locations. The efficiency of information collection, creation, transfer,
assimilation, accession, and confirmation is driven by the capability of the XYZ ACO to efficiently share
information across the enterprise. Shared information will result in improved services, reduce cost and
enhance efficiency.
  Implications  All participants within the enterprise must understand the relationship between value of information,
sharing of information, and accessibility of information. Information sharing is considered in relation to
information security so that confidential information is not compromised. A standardized model must be
developed for information sharing to ensure all required information is available for various demands.
Sharing information must meet the requirements of stakeholders.
BUSINESS SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE VIEWPOINT
Performance Business Performance Management
  Statement Ability to track business performance,  e.g. service performance reporting, cash payout to partner per
day, average payout per Member per provider, etc.
  Rationale Determine cash position of business at any time, identify payout trends, quality of service trends,  setting
informed targets for LOBs,  etc.
  Implications Implement automated reporting scorecard for performance monitoring and target setting for lines of
business
Centralization Centralize Payment Management
  Statement Maintain a single payment system for provider partners in the network
  Rationale Improve operational efficiency thereby reducing operating cost, which in turn improves profitability
  Implications Implement single payment system to manage payments to  provider partners (PCP groups, Specialists,
Service Providers)
Uniqueness Single version of Member (Patient)
  Statement Maintain single version of member information across all lines of business
  Rationale Enables cross-sell / opportunity management (e.g. solicitation) to Members (Patient), driving additional
revenue and profit.
  Implications Implement a governable, centralized data repository for Member information/data sharing across the
enterprise
  Integration   Enterprise Information Integration
  Statement Maintain information integration capability that facilitate information/data exchange across lines of
business
  Rationale Improve timeliness of reported information for decision making, operational visibility, data/information
sharing
  Implications Enable automated enterprise data/information exchange across lines of business
DATA ARCHITECTURE VIEWPOINT
Data Security Data is Secure within the XYZ ACO environment (also Security Views and Enterprise Security
Viewpoint)
Statement Data is protected from unauthorized use, access, disruption, modification, perusal, inspection, recording
and disclosure. Data protection of confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and availability.
Rationale Open sharing of data and release of data throughout relevant legislations must be balanced against the
need to restrict the availability of classified, proprietary, permitted, professional, and sensitive
information. Current laws and regulations require the safeguarding of data security and privacy. Pre-
decisional (work-in-process, not yet authorized for release) data must be well protected to avoid
unwarranted speculation, misinterpretation, and inappropriate purpose use.
Implications Collection of classified and de-classified data represents a large task requiring review and de-
classification procedures to maintain appropriate and suitable control. Information owners and users
must determine whether aggregation results at a higher classification level. XYZ ACO needs a
qualification policy and procedures to govern this review and de-classification. Access to information
based on a need-to-know policy can ensure regular reviews of information. Adequate and secure access
to information requires that security requirements are implemented at the data level (not the application
level), and must be designed into data elements from the beginning; it should not and cannot be added
![Page 7, Figure 1](../../public/subject-assets/Ggo/T4. Recursos. Arquitectura empresarial/Practica AE 2024/Teaching Case Notes -with bios/Teaching Case Notes -with bios_page_007.png)

### Page 8
later. Data security safeguards may be for “view only”, or “never see”. Sensitivity labeling for access to
pre-decisional, decisional, classified, sensitive, private, confidential, or proprietary information must be
determined. (also Information and Security Viewpoints)
Accessibility  Data is Accessible (also Information Viewpoint)
Statement The purpose of data management is to make data maximally accessible, visible and transparent to the
Enterprise as a whole (ease of use).
Rationale Wide access to data leads to efficiency and effectiveness in decision making, and affords timely response
to information requests and service delivery. Staff time is saved and consistency of data is improved.
Implications Access to data does not constitute understanding of the data. Personnel should take caution not to
misinterpret information. Access to data does not necessarily grant the user access rights to modify or
disclose the data. This will require an education process and a change in the organizational culture,
which currently supports a belief in ‘‘ownership’’ of data by functional units.
Shareability  Data is shared in XYZ ACO (also Information and Security Viewpoints)
Statement Stakeholders have access to the data necessary to assist medical personnel and patients. Data is shared
across the entire enterprise functions and organizations.
Rationale Data is easily accessible when it is shared across the enterprise and appropriate access to accurate data is
essential to XYZ ACO. It is cost-effective to maintain accurate data in a single location instead of
maintaining duplicative information in multiple locations. The efficiency of data collection, creation,
transfer, assimilation, accession, and confirmation is driven by the capability of the XYZ ACO to
efficiently share data across the enterprise. Shared data will result in improved services, reduce cost and
enhance efficiency.
Implications All participants within the enterprise must understand the relationship between value, sharing and
accessibility of data. A common set of policies, procedures, and standards governing data management
and access for the short and long term must be established and developed. This principle is in accordance
with the principle of data security. Under no circumstances must the sharing of data cause confidential
data to be compromised. A standardized model must be developed for data sharing to ensure all required
data is available for various demands. Sharing of data must meet the requirements of stakeholders.
Value Data is an asset
Statement Data has value to the enterprise and is managed accordingly.
Rationale Data is a valuable corporate resource; it has real, measurable value. The purpose of collecting data is to
aid decision-making. Accurate, timely data is critical to accurate, timely decisions. Most corporate assets
are carefully managed, and data is no exception.
Implications All organizations within XYZ ACO must understand the relationship between the value, sharing and
accessibility of data. Stewards must have the authority and means to manage the integrity of data for
which they are accountable. A cultural transition from ‘‘data ownership’’ thinking to ‘‘data
stewardship’’ thinking is needed. The role of data stewardship is critical because obsolete, incorrect, or
inconsistent data could be passed to enterprise personnel and adversely affect decisions across the
enterprise. Procedures must be developed and used to prevent and correct errors in data and to improve
those processes that produce flawed information. Data quality will need to be measured and steps taken
to improve data quality.
APPLICATION VIEWPOINT
Ease of Use Applications are easy to use (also Enterprise Viewpoint)
Statement Application should be easy to use and require minimal time for training.
Rationale It saves training time and application misuses by stakeholders. Also this helps proficiency and optimal
application operating conditions.
Implications Applications should have a common “look-and-feel” which requires careful design of the interfaces and
application and their usability
Independence Applications are technology independent
Statement Applications are technology independent and must run on multiple operating systems or platforms. An
application may be independently modified or replaced without compromising other applications.
Rationale Applications remain operable when there are operating system upgrades or replacements; cost is
contained.
Implications Standards must be used in order to guarantee application portability. Application architecture must be
designed adopting this principle.  Moreover, sometimes a middleware layer should be used to separate
the applications from platform.
Structural Quality Applications are well-structured
Statement Applications must be structured to accommodate the perspectives of all XYZ ACO user communities.
Rationale Applications take into account different communities’ needs
Implications Design must be carefully planned and developed and prototyped to verify and validate the functionality.
Consistency   Application design is consistent
![Page 8, Figure 1](../../public/subject-assets/Ggo/T4. Recursos. Arquitectura empresarial/Practica AE 2024/Teaching Case Notes -with bios/Teaching Case Notes -with bios_page_008.png)

### Page 9
Statement Applications should be consistent for all stakeholders as far as naming standards and terminology and
usage.
Rationale This will create a common understanding about the applications throughout XYZ ACO user community,
ease of use, flow of information and maintenance.
Implications This requires careful design of naming standards and acronyms with input from user communities to
implement consistent applications.
SECURITY VIEWPOINT
Transparency Information Transparency and Visibility (also Enterprise Viewpoint).
Statement Data and information must be transparent to stakeholders
Rationale Transparency of data and information must be based on need to know and responsibility of users.
Implications Authorizations must be given and authentication performed on all classes of users of the application
systems.
Security  Information Security (also Information and Data Viewpoints)
Statement XYZ ACO should have secure risk free computer environment. For all stakeholders and users.
Rationale Strategic Security Vision
Implications Confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patient, personal, and business data must be secured.
Systems, data, and technologies must be protected from unauthorized access, operation, and
manipulation.
Sharability Secure sharing of  XYZ ACO data and information (also Information and Data Viewpoints)
Statement Stakeholders must have secure access to the information necessary to assist medical personnel and
patients.
Rationale Appropriate access to accurate information is essential to the services of ACO and must be secure.
Implications DRM (digital rights management) technology can extend access with usage control using
cryptography to protect data that may be outsourced or published on the network.



XYZ ACO Business Strategy Statement
XYZ ACO has developed a new approach to providing managed health care for private patients in the USA. XYZ ACO was
formed by a partnership between XYZ Hospital, 10 Provider groups consisting of approximately 920 physicians,  630
independent specialists, pharmacies, and laboratories. The intent is to create an accountable care organization with a new ca re
delivery model which would comply with and be governed by the Affordable Care Act of the CMS. The Affordable Care Act
includes a number of provisions designed to improve the quality of Medicare services, support innovation and the establishment
of new payment models in the program, better align Medicare payments with provider costs, strengthen program integrity within
Medicare, and put Medicare on a firmer financial footing. In addition to improving quality, ACO initiatives seek to reduce
growth in health care expenditures. It is widely recognized that the current trajectory for the nation's health care spending  is
unsustainable. Medicare beneficiaries share the burden of rising costs, as they pay higher premiums and larger cost -sharing
obligations and out of- pocket expenses.
The XYZ ACO group has now been operating independently for three years, with each entity still separate ly managed and
accounted for on separate balance sheets and healthcare contracts. The strategic business vision is to  form an Accountable
Healthcare Origination (i.e. ACO) to give coordinated high quality care for their patients. The goal is to manage heal thcare
costs, provide high quality care services, and be accountable for the care and a profitable organization.
Corporate Concerns
• There is no clear concept of ‘Member (Patient)’ across the group. As the group’s mission is now primarily profitable
managed health care this is a major flaw in the data and business architectures, as no ready measures of income per Member
are available across the group.
• Recent privacy legislation complicates use of Member information in any case, and an analysis is require d of these
implications, for preparation of a privacy statement.
• Financial reporting is required, at least on a monthly basis, to be of operational and tactical use. No visibility across all
units to manage cost and provide high quality care.
• There is no total business architecture on which to base and manage operation of the group as a whole.
• Hospitals use different application packages.
• Each business within the group uses different application packages. There is no basis for achieving economi es of scale in
materials and resource purchasing or management, neither for cost management nor for cross-selling services to identified
customers.
• None of the infrastructure currently supports operations within an integrated business model.

2.2 Information Viewpoint Models
A selection of models developed for this viewpoint are given
in this section. The Information Viewpoint models are
focused on the information views (of the viewpoint), and
included here are the hierarchy of information needs of XYZ
ACO, the core information needs of XYZ ACO Stakeholders,
and the proposed information flows of main busine sses in
XYZ ACO.
Hierarchy of Information needs of XYZ ACO. Figure
3 summarizes the hierarchy of information needs into three
categories, namely strategic, tactical, and operational
information.

Stakeholders. Figure 4 di splays the core information
requirements of XYZ ACO Stakeholders. Physicians need to
know all necessary information about patients so that they
can make diagnostic decisions efficiently. The Physician
Schedule involves information of the daily, weekly, and
monthly schedules. Service information relates to the Nurse
Schedule, Theater Schedule, Office Information, and any
other services’ information provided by supporting health
care institutions. Patients are able to access detailed
information about the phy sicians’ performance, reputation,
skills, and schedules to help them to make a choice of
physician. In addition the Federal Government can make
effective financial decisions about healthcare systems based
on the performance of participating organizations.
Information Flow Model.  Figure 5 illustrates the
information flow for the main businesses in XYZ ACO. The
core information that main businesses require include patient
information, physician schedules, physician performance
records, service information and  organization information.
Through a Cloud -based service, the main businesses can
access systems and obtain the information they need
according to their authorizations.

2.3 Business Systems Viewpoint Models
A selection of additional models for this viewpoint is given
in this section. The Business Systems Viewpoint models
focus on business related views such as business process
views, systems, business information entities and other
resources that are used to perform XYZ ACO’s operational
activities.
Patient Appointment Sc heduling. Figure 6 is a high -
level process view of the Patient Appointment Scheduling
business process. A patient or authorized user (primary care
physician (PCP), specialist), Patient Care Representative
(PCR)) may use the online, self -service appointment
scheduling system to schedule or update appointments with
a PCP or specialist.  Alternatively, a PCR may log the
appointment information on behalf of the patient who has
called in.  An Enterprise Calendar Manager (ECM)
component provides the necessary cal endar services for
logging appointments.
Service Performance Management. Figure 7 provides
a high -level view of the business process to generate the
Service Performance Report (SPR), a feature of the Service
Performance Management capability. Only author ized users
such PCPs, Specialists and XYZ ACO management are
allowed to run this report. As part of XYZ’s accountable
health care strategy, evaluating and monitoring service
quality performance information among PCPs and
Specialists is critical.  Release 1  of the Business Systems
Architecture will implement a workload and service quality
reporting function to facilitate visibility into care service
quality performance and accountable information regarding
PCPs and specialists.
Business Information Entities for Release 1. Table 4
shows the business information entities for Release 1 of the
EA initiative selected from the complete information analysis
done in the team project.  The principles of concern are
accessibility, information sharing and security.

2.4 Data Viewpoint Models
A selection of models in this viewpoint of relevance to
Release 1 of the EA Initiative, developed by the team, is
given in this section. Data viewpoint models focus on the
data of the software applications and included here is a
CRUD Matrix and the conceptual data model for XYZ ACO
Release 1.
CRUD Matrix.  Table 5 is a partial CRUD matrix
obtained from the data analysis to identify the XYZ ACO
organizations that create (C), review (R) , update (U), and
delete (D).  A list of data entities and the business s ystems
that access the data based on the requirement is shown.
Conceptual Data Model. Figure 8 is a class diagram of
the conceptual data model of XYZ ACO. The diagram shows
the main classes along with their attributes and data types.
The relationship among classes is governed by the share -
ability, accessibility and security principles.

2.5 Application Viewpoint Models
Additional models developed by the team for this viewpoint
is given in this section. The Application Viewpoint Models
focus on the applications of the EA, and here use cases for
the proposed Release 1 are included, namely the S ervice
Performance Management Reporting System and the
Physician Performance Reporting System.
Service Performance Management Reporting
System. This system includes the Service Performance
Reporting System. The application architecture to realize the
functionality of Release 1 addresses Service Performance

### Page 15
Management in terms of the concerns pertinent to assessing
doctors’ performance and quality of service provided to
patients treated at XYZ ACO facilities.  This essentially
includes reporting on the daily , weekly and monthly work
schedule, medical procedures performed, as well as patients’
review of health care service received during visits.
Physician Performance Reporting. Figure 9 is a high-
level use case diagram for the Physician Performance
Reporting System. When the patient visits the physician for
a consultation or surgery procedure, the name of the doctor
(physician or surgeon) is stored in the database along with
the date and time of the visit. A XYZ ACO manager can
request a report of the service  performance of a specific
physician (or group of physicians) on the number of patients
attended for a specific period (day, week, month, or year).
The system accesses the database and prints the requested
report.





Patient Appointment Manager System.  Figure 10
illustrates the Patient Appointment Manager System use case.
The patient requests an appointment at a hospital to visit a
specialist, or to receive a service at a medical laboratory.
Based on availability for an appointment the system accesses
the patient record, records the entered appointment
information (date, time, and place), and confirms the
appointment with the involved parties (e.g. patient,
specialist). The patient or physician can cancel an
appointment, and the system will record the ca ncelation in
the database. When a patient requests a prescription the
system checks for the availability of the requested
prescription at the XYZ ACO affiliated pharmacy, and
coordinates the delivery of the medicine to a location for
pick-up.




2.6 Enterprise Security Viewpoint models
Due to the scope and complexity of the security requirements
of an enterprise the security viewpoint is regarded as a
composite viewpoint, and hence called the enterprise security
viewpoint comprising all security-related concerns of the EA
initiative, including physical, data, information, application,
and infrastructure security. A selection of models developed
by the team for this viewpoint is given in this section, namely
the Composite Enterprise Security Viewpoint, High Level
Security Model of XYZ ACO, and the Information Security
Management Model.
Composite Enterprise Security Viewpoint. Figure 11
illustrates how security is viewed from a holistic st andpoint
and its coverage for all enterprise domains.





High Level Security Model of XYZ ACO. Figure 12 shows
the security level requirements which involves the
infrastructure that is rarely visible to the business functions.
The fundamental purpose of having security is to protect the
value of the systems and information assets of the enterprise.
According to The Open Group (TOGAF 9.1, 2011) the
generally accepted areas of concern for to security architect
are:
• Authentication: The substantiation of the identity of
a person or entity related to the enterprise or system in some
way.
• Authorization: The definition and enforcement of
permitted capabilities for a person or entity whose identity
has been established.
• Audit: The ability to provide forensic data attesting
that the systems have been used in accordance with stated
security policies.
• Assurance: The ability to test and prove that the
enterprise architecture has the security attributes required to
uphold the stated security policies.
• Availability: The ability of the enterprise to function
without service interruption or depletion despite abnormal or
malicious events.
• Asset Protection:  The protection of information
assets from loss or unintended disclosure, and resources from
unauthorized and unintended use.
• Administration: The ability to add and change
security policies, add or change how policies are
implemented in the enterprise, and add or change the persons
or entities related to the systems.
• Risk Management:  Is the organization’s attitude
and tolerance for risk. Note that risk management here is
different from the s pecial definition found in financial
markets and insurance institutions that have formal risk
management departments.

Information Security Management.  Figure 13 presents
information security management in the enterprise at three
main levels, namely strategic, tactical, and operational. The
strategic level impacts the corporate strategy, the tactical
level relates to processes and methodologies used to manage
security, and the operational level addresses the installation
and operation of security tools and measures.
