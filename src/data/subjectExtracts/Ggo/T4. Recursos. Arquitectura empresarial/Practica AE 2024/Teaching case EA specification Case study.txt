ABSTRACT

A graduate course in enterprise architecture had a team project component in which a real-world business case, provided by an
industry sponsor, formed the basis of the project charter and the architecture statement of work.  The paper aims to share the
team project experience on developing the architecture specifications based on the business case of an accountable health care
organization. Students collaborated as a team in various roles to develop the architecture specifications for a new business
initiative of the sponsoring organization, XYZ ACO. The teaching case describes the case study approach and the architecture
approach adopted for the architecture process, and is accompanied by Teaching Case Notes which provide a selection of the
models developed by members of the project team towards the architecture specifications. The course started with coverage of
enterprise architecture theory , best practices and standards, and the team project gave students the opportunity to apply their
theoretical knowledge and “learn by doing”. Students were challenged to interpret the business case, the project charter and
project requirements, and each team member was allocated an architecture viewpoint and a role to play. The Teaching Case
presents a summary of the team project and the lessons learned in performing the project.

Keywords: Design specification, Architecture, Process improvement, Modeling.

1. INTRODUCTION

Developing enterprise architecture (EA) specifications for an
enterprise is a non-trivial task, especially in the ever
changing business and technology environment of today. In
the case of health care organizations the complexity of their
business operations have escalated as new legislation has
been introduced, and there is increasing demand for
improved quality of health care services including Medicare
services, and reduction in health care expenditure. Health
care organizations are also challenged by their competitors,
and must leverage all their assets to survive and prosper.
Emerging information technologies offer opportunities to
achieve such goals, but there are also significant challenges
such as disparate systems in use, concerns such as ease-of-
use, transparency, accountability and security, to name a few.
Project-Based Learning (PBL) engages students to
apply academic knowledge to applications in the real world.
It has been found that PBL stimulates student learning by
using acquired knowledge for applied learning (Rivet &
Krajcik, 2004; Steenkamp, White & Kakish, 2002). Team-
based student projects have become common in coursework
in the field of Information Technology (IT), as reported by
many authors including Meyer (2005) and Stephens (2001).
In a literature survey of student team effectiveness Stephens
(2001) has found that there is a need for effective teamwork
management in the academic context. A standards-based
approach to team projects has been followed by the senior

author over many years, where teams are informed by
international standards and best practices in IT projects.
In this paper a case study format was used, after Cappel
and Schwager (2002), to report on experience in a team
project for a graduate course in enterprise architecture (EA),
and falls in the category of a project-based case. For
background, the goal of the graduate course was to provide a
comprehensive perspective of enterprise architecture within
the context of the global business environment of a
competitive enterprise. Intended outcomes for the course
were that students are able to
• Identify, interpret and adopt the best practices in the
field of IT architecture design and deployment as promoted
by international standards organizations.
• Lead and manage the process of IT architecture
design within the organization.
• Participate in architecture design project as lead
designer.
• Define the viewpoints and views relevant to
stakeholders, and design models of the enterprise
architecture.
The course was offered in blended mode of delivery
requiring that teaching and collaboration be done in both
face-to-face and virtual modes. The pedagogy was designed
to incorporate various didactical methods suited to the adult
learner, and requiring higher-order cognitive skills such as
the application of concepts and theories, analysis of the
business case, synthesis of concerns and principles as
relevant for the deliverables of the project, and evaluation of
alternative models (Bloom et al., 1956).  The pedagogy also
recognizes the importance of problem solving and
interpersonal skills and communication that are valued by
academia and practice alike (Tang et al., 2001).  The course
started with covering the theory and best practices of EA,
during which students executed individual home assignments
as part of the course requirements. Orientation was provided
for these assignments and detailed feedback on student
papers followed after grading them. Part of the course
involved an industry sponsored team projec t which
commenced after a substantial part of the EA syllabus had
been covered. The team project exposed students to a real-
world situation, challenges and concerns and a “learn by
doing” experience. Team members were required to
collaborate in various roles relating to the architecture
process, starting with the interpretation of the business case,
the project charter and project requirements. Working on a
team project gave the small class of students experience to
work on a sizable project in the limited period of the
academic term, and was complementary to some theory-
based individual assignments mentioned earlier.  In addition
the team project offered students the opportunity to apply
standards and best practices in EA and team management.
The paper aims to share the team project experience in
the course when developing the architecture design
specifications based on the real-world business case of an
Accountable Health Care organization, here called XYZ
ACO Inc. With the urgent need of affordable healthcare in
the United States the opportunity to collaborate with the
project sponsor was regarded as opportune and appropriate.
Sections of the paper include the case study approach
followed, the architecture approach adopted, and some
models of the Enterprise Architecture Specifications, and
concludes with a summary of the lessons learned in
performing the project. The paper is complemented by
Teaching Case Notes (Steenkamp et al., 2012) with
additional models developed by the teams that are available
on request.

2. CASE STUDY APPROACH

A project-based case, also called a “systems solution case”
(Cappel and Schwager (2002), requires sustained
involvement of all stakeholders to meet the requirements,
and is particularly suited for IT and IS courses such as IT
architecture, networking, systems analysis and design,
programming, and systems development, as reported in
several papers by the senior author, and also by others
(Hogue, A, Kapralos, B. and Desjardins, F., 2011). This
system solution case reports on an initiative relating to the
Health Care Delivery System of XYZ ACO Inc. The project
work and architecture tasks focused on developing the EA
Architecture Specifications during the Planning and Analysis
stages of the architecture process, and are described in
Section 3. XYZ ACO’s mission, strategic direction, core
principles and requirements for the new XYZ ACO
architecture initiative were provided by the XYZ ACO
sponsor, and along with the course’s teamwork assignments
stated in the project charter, framed the team project
requirements.

2.1 XYZ ACO Inc. Business Case
XYZ ACO was formed in a partnership between the XYZ
ACO Hospital and 10 Provider Groups consisting of
approximately 920 physicians, 630 independent specialists,
pharmacies, and laboratories. The XYZ ACO mission is to
improve the quality of health care services, including
Medicare services, and reduce the growth in health care
expenditures.  It aims to achieve this by providing
coordinated high quality care services, and to introduce
economies of scale in negotiating one contract with all the
payers on behalf of all the groups of the enterprise. As part
of the XYZ ACO Strategic vision a new approach was
formulated to provide quality healthcare while managing
healthcare for private patients in the USA. The intent has
been to create an accountable care organization using a novel
care delivery model which would comply with, and be
governed by, the Affordable Care Act of the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The Affordable
Care Act includes a number of provisions designed to:
improve the quality of Medicare services; support innovation
and the establishment of new payment models in the
program; better align Medicare payments with provider costs;
strengthen program integrity within Medicare; and put
Medicare on a firmer financial footing. In addition to
improving quality, XYZ ACO’s initiatives seek to reduce
escalation of health care expenditures. It is widely
recognized that the current trajectory for the nation's health
care spending is unsustainable. Medicare beneficiaries share
the burden of rising costs, as they pay higher premiums and
larger cost-sharing.
The XYZ ACO Group has now been operating
independently for three years, and despite strong leadership
each business entity is still separately managed and
accounted for on separate balance sheets and healthcare
contracts, making profitability a challenge. Corporate

concerns include:
1. There is no clear concept of ‘Member (Patient)’
across the group. Recent privacy legislation complicates use
of Member information in any case, and an analysis is
required of these implications, for preparation of a privacy
statement.
2. Financial reporting is required, at least on a monthly
basis, to be of operational and tactical use. There is n o
visibility across all units to manage cost and provide high
quality care.
3
. There is no comprehensive business architecture on
which to base and manage operations of the group as a whole.
4. Hospitals use different application packages.
5. Each business within the group uses different
application packages. There is no basis for achieving
economies of scale in materials and resource purchasing or
management, neither for cost management nor for cross-
selling services to identified customers.
6. The infrastructure currently does not support
operations within an integrated business model.
7. XYZ ACO uses a range of IT Practice Management
Systems, and since the group’s mission is now primarily
towards profitable managed health care this diversity of
systems presents a major flaw in the data and business
architectures, as no ready measures of income per member
are available across the group.
Figure 1 shows the XYZ ACO Business Capability Map
for management of categories of services provided by the
project sponsor (ACO Inc., 2012). IT support was found to
be at Level 1 Capability, and the EA Project described in this
paper is one of the initiatives to improve this capability.
Key factors for successful implementation and
operation of the intended accountable care organization
using the new care delivery model were provided in the
business case. These include care management, financial and
performance analytics, predictive modeling, electronic
medical records, quality reporting, data warehouses,
evidence guidelines and care protocols, provider profiling
and network management, and are to be implemented by
XYZ ACO. The team project focused on scheduling,
reporting and performance management.

2.2 Project Charter
XYZ ACO Inc. realizes it cannot deliver the strategic vision
and addr
ess the above mentioned concerns with the current
EA and business capability, and are planning to implement
its future EA in several project releases. With agreement
from XYZ ACO Management the project sponsor presented
a Requ
est for Architecture Work to the EA Project Team
outlining the project charter. The team interpreted the
requirements in terms of a Statement of Architecture Work
document using the template in Table 1, which includes hints
for using the template.
The project charter defined the deliverables for the team
assignment
s of the course, as well as the scope of the EA
initiative to be undertaken for XYZ ACO.
Deliverables for Project.  The key deliverables were
the Architecture Project Plan and Statement of Architectur e
Work document for the sponsored EA initiative described in
Section 2.1; architecture principles derived from the
concerns stated in the Business Case; architecture analysis
for each of the allocated viewpoints; and the Architecture
Specification Document.

Scope of EA Initiative.  In accordance with the purpose
of the EA initiative for XYZ ACO Inc. the project team was
charged to develop the Architecture Specifications that
address specific concerns relating to accountable and
affordable health care as part of the group’s strategic vision
stated in Section 2.1. The scope of the project was
constrained and governed by the business drivers and
concerns as defined in the Architecture Statement of Work
(refer Table 1).  A complete list of concerns and principles
are provided in the Teaching Case Notes, Table 2 along with
descriptions, rationale and implications of each. XYZ ACO’s
key architecture principles are summarized in the list below:
Principle 1: Improve care quality and access to health
care
Principle 2: Affordability - reduce the cost of health
services
Principle 3: Provide Information transparency among
participating businesses and stakeholders
Principle 4: Design must promote reuse within and
among XYZ hospital chain
Principle 5: Provide a flexible balance in complexity,
manageability and performance
Principle 6: Components must maintain high cohesion
and a low coupling
Principle 7: High Security of information, business
systems, data, application and infrastructure
The EA initiative is to be implemented in several
project releases. Release 1 will address the Service
Performance Management Capability to support Principle 1
and Principle 3 above and represents the scope of the
Architecture Description, as specified in this case study. In
addition Principles 4 to 7 above were to be implemented for
all viewpoints of architecture development.

individuals (e.g. Patients and Payers) are shown on the left
colored in light gray.  XYZ ACO would serve as orchestrator
between internal and external entities, with an Enterprise
Information Integration (EII) component providing data
integration capabilities both internally and externally. The
EII component will be partially implemented in Release 1 to
support Service Performance Management in the areas of
Patient Appointment Management, Service Performance
Management and Enterprise Calendar Management. Future
releases will address principles of the business systems
architecture viewpoint focused on the Centralized Payment
Management using a unique member identification number.
The application architecture to realize Service Performance
Management capabilities should address concerns pertinent
to assessing the primary care physician/ specialist functions
and quality of service provided to patients treated at XYZ
ACO hospitals. This includes reporting on their daily,
weekly and monthly work schedules, medical procedures
performed, and patients’ review of health care services
received during visits and/or treatment at XYZ ACO
hospitals.
For Release 1 a Performance Analysis of the initiative
was done in terms of Goals and Measures at three levels,
namely the Organization Level (strategic), the Process Level
(tactical) and Activity Level (operational), focusing on the
Design and Implementation, and Management activities to
achieve the stated Goals and Measures. Table 2 is a summary
of this analysis, and facilitated the alignment of IT Strategic
Planning with the enterprise strategy, particularly as it has
bearing on the new XYZ ACO Health Care initiative. At the
Activity Level the scope and planning for the EA Project are
described in the Architecture Project Plan and the Statement
of Architecture Work (developed as part of Team
Assignment 1). The architecture approach followed by the
project team is described in Section 3.

2.3 Teamwork
The team was formed based on architecture roles and
interests of the five students in the class, and the architecture
viewpoints assigned. The team was culturally diverse and all
students but one were foreign born. All students were
educated up to the undergraduate degree level outside the
United States and all of them studied for their masters’
degrees in the United States. Experience in the fields of
architecture and application development varied among team
members, with some expertise and skills in business analysis,
information systems development, software engineering, and
database modeling represented in the team. General
guidelines were provided regarding expectations of
teamwork as well as the goals and project requirements
within the context of the project charter. Team members
were assigned to particular viewpoints, with the course
faculty member and the XYZ ACO project sponsor playing
active roles in the project. On-ground team project tutorials
were held by the faculty member during which potential
views (of the viewpoints) were considered, the
representation schemes and notation discussed and
determined for the models that were being developed.
Guidance was given to team members for each viewpoint
entertained in the project in the form of design patterns,
templates, and representative principles for developing
models for each viewpoint. The concerns of the target
organization were presented by the project sponsor, and
further analyzed by the team. The project sponsor also
supported the team when there was need for clarification on
particular aspects of the business case. The assignment
deliverables developed during the course are addressed in
Section 3.4. Team members were required to collaborate
with each other as they developed models for the views of
the respective viewpoints assigned to them, making the
teamwork a very real architecture experience. The team
became aware of the importance of alignment and
architecture governance for the XYZ ACO initiative within
the context of the enterprise strategy. Ultimately the intent
was to obtain seamless integration of the viewpoint
architectures developed by each team member.
Factors influencing successful teamwork include
following a defined teamwork process. This involves
obtaining participation and involvement of all team members,
and maintaining sound team management. In this project the
faculty member served as team lead and assumed
responsibility for managing the teamwork process. Quality
individual efforts should be followed by the integration of
the independent deliverables into a coherent result, here the
EA Specification Document. A key success factor for
working professionals when participating in this type of team
project is regular communication among team members.
Team members should be committed to the team by sharing
a sense of purpose, working in the assigned roles as business
and technology architects, and displaying mutual trust in
each other.

2.4 Selection of the Architecture Approach
Extensive experience has been built over a number years on
architecture approaches in the education context by the
senior author. The students were exposed to a number of
widely published architecture approaches (CEA, 2012; The
Open
Group, 2012; Cameron and Purao, 2010; Cameron,
2008; Zachman, 2007; Schekkerman, 2006; Steenkamp et al,
2004), and were well versed in the frameworks,
methodologies, and tools that are used in the practice.
Projects like the one reported here require an agile and lean
approach which requires student teams to apply the theory of
architecture development with rigor while also providing
experience with interpreting the project charter, developing a
project plan, performing analysis of the organization, and
understanding the process and project requirements for the
EA project. There was a tight time constraint to meet the
project charter, and an agile and lean architecture approach
that has been used in a number of architecture projects over
several years was adopted in this project.

2.5 Architecture Viewpoints Addressed
The architecture viewpoints of interest for the XYZ ACO
health care initiative and the EA team project were
considered in allocating teamwork responsibilities. With the
scope of the project charter in mind, viewpoints entertained
were the Information, Business System , Data, Application
and Enterprise Security Viewpoints; the overarching
Enterprise Viewpoint was addressed by faculty and the
project sponsor.

3. ARCHITECTURE APPROACH

An architecture approach for developing the enterprise
architecture specifications involves the architecture
processes and steps of the methodology supporting the
processes to be followed, and the tools to construct the
models of the architecture. The selected architecture
approach is systematic and has the features of agile and lean
development as described in this section. This approach is
characterized by five essential components, namely the
architecture principles and concerns relevant for an EA
initiative, the architecture meta-architecture framework, the
architecture process model, the supporting architecture
methodology, and the tool environment for developing the
models for the EA architecture specification. These
components are described in brief in the next sub-sections.

3.1 Meta-Architecture Framework
The complexity of systems and processes of medium to large
enterprises requires that IT systems not be viewed in
isolation, but that all relevant factors and concerns be taken
into consideration when developing architecture models. The
meta-architecture framework is based on the interpretation of
architecture, as the fundamental organization of a system
embodied in its components, their relationships to each other,
and to the environment, and the principles guiding the
architecture design and evolution. The architecture design
specifications are a blueprint of the policies, plans, processes,
systems and stakeholders of the organization, and serve as a
starting point for analysis, design, and decision making. The
goal of rigorously documenting the EA is to provide insight
in the organizational structures, processes, and technologies
that make up the organization, allowing opportunities for
improvements in efficiency and strategy alignment to be
examined. A meta-architecture framework provides an
analytical frame of reference to deal with the complexities
when planning, developing and integrating the constituent
architectures of the EA. It provides guidance by analyzing
the enterprise assets in terms of viewpoints and constituent
views when defining architecture models of a target
enterprise system. This analytical schema enables architects
to consider all relevant organizational matters, including
concerns of stakeholders, principles underpinning decisions
of policy makers and architects, roles of stakeholders,
standards, and model notations when modeling the
architecture specifications.
The analysis was performed by the project team of the
XYZ ACO Group, structured into the Enterprise Information,
Business Systems, Data, Application and Enterprise Security
Viewpoints, and given in the Teaching Case Notes, Table 1.
The meta-architecture framework schema is given in Table 3
below. In the project the analysis was done for each
viewpoint of concern providing the data for each cell in the
matrix.

3.1.1 Summary of Me ta-Architecture Framework
Attributes: The meta-architecture framework has a matrix
representation scheme with attributes to be instantiated for
the models of views of viewpoints of importance to
stakeholders. The terminology used here is reviewed briefly.
A Viewpoint defines abstractions on the set of models
representing the EA. It is a specification of the conventions
for constructing and using the views that contain identity,
state, and behavior of a model. The term View is used to
refer to the expression of a system’s architecture (strategic,
tactical and operational) with respect to a particular
viewpoint and may be of a particular Type, namely
conceptual, logical or physical. A viewpoint may have one or
more views that are expressed in terms of models. Viewpoint
Models are the collection of models that are developed for
the views of a viewpoint. A view is based on a pattern or
template from which to develop individual models by
establishing the purposes and audience for the view, and the
techniques for its creation and analysis. This taxonomy may
be used to manage the inherent complexities in architecture
work. When modeling a view a particular language is used to
describe the view as defined below. The Architecture Phase
refers to the phase in the architecture process model when
the model of a view is developed.
Other framework attributes are summarized next:
•
 Purpose pertains to the intent and use of architecture
views, and to facilitate the expression and communicatio n of
the viewpoints thereby laying a foundation for quality
through standardization of elements and practices for
architecture descriptions. The purpose is determined by what
a stakeholder wants to achieve. The purpose is categorized
into the processes of designing, deciding, and informing.
Design views support architects and designers in the design
process from initial sketch to detailed design, and typically
focus on a specific conceptual domain (e.g. application
architecture, business process model) but can also be used to
define the inter -dependencies between domain architectures;
Deciding views assist managers in the process of decision
making by offering insight into cross -domain architecture
relations, typically through projections and intersections o f
underlying models (ex: cross -reference tables, landscape
maps, lists, and reports); Informing views help to inform any
stakeholder about the enterprise architecture, in order to
achieve understanding, obtain commitment, and convince
adversaries (e.g. illustrations, animations, flyers, etc).
• Stakeholder(s) refer to people who have key roles in,
or concerns about, the EA such as for example users,
developers, or managers. Stakeholders may be individuals,
teams, or organizations interested in a view of an
architecture initiative.
• Concerns and Principles  embodied in a view.
Concerns are the key interests important to the stakeholders
of the target system, and determine the acceptability of a new
architecture design for the stakeholders. Architecture
Principles provide guidance for analysts, architects and
designers when developing architecture models. (refer

• Content refers to what is contained in a view, and is
characterized by the three abstraction levels: Detail,
Coherence, and Overview. Detail provides the necessary
information at the various architecture layers to the
interested stakeholders in the various domain s (e.g.
information, product, process, and organization domains at
the business layer; data domain and application domain at
the application layer; and technical infrastructure domain at
the technology layer of the architecture). Detail can span the
gamut from UML components and deployment diagrams to
business process models. Coherence content extends the
view to more than one layer in order to focus on
architecture relationships (e.g. process -uses-system or
application-uses-object). Typical stakeholders ar e
operational managers responsible for a collection of IT
services or business processes. Overview content represents
multiple layers at a very high level (e.g. an executive
overview) to be addressed by management and enterprise
architects.
•
 Layer includes business, application, and
technology layers (these layers correspond to the business,
system, and technology levels in the Zachman framework).
• Aspect refers to the structure, behavior, or
information (these aspects correspond to the network,
function, and data aspects of the Zachman framework).
• Modeling language is the syntactical definition
used when developing a model, and is formal, semi -formal,
textual or graphic.
• Standard/ Best practice refers to the de facto or de
jure standard or best pr actice adopted when developing a
model.
• Tool refers to the automated capability used to
develop the model, and which supports the modeling
languages for the definition, development, generation,
editing, and management of architecture views.

3.2 Concerns and Principles
Concerns and principles pertain to the EA initiative’s
functioning, development, and operation, including
considerations such as performance, reliability, security,
distribution, and extensibility. The principles should be
stable, but flexible enough to accommodate changes in the
IT environment. Table 4 shows the main concerns and
principles for this team project, here completed for the
overarching Enterprise Viewpoint using the TOGAF 9
template (The Open G roup, 2012). Each principle is
identified by name and number, a descriptive statement, the
rationale and implications. Decisions drawn from the
Enterprise Viewpoint may have greater long-term value
than those made from any particular viewpoint. Table 2 in
the Teaching Case Notes provides the principles for all the
viewpoints considered by the project team that guided the
architecture and design level development efforts for the
XYZ ACO project.

3.3 Architecture Process Model
Like other life cycle process models an architecture process
model structures the architecture processes into interrelated
life cycle stages to depict the tasks of architects an d
developers who will plan, manage, develop, evaluate and
maintain the enterprise architecture. The Architecture
Process Model in Figure 3 illustrates the stages of
architecture development processes and the relationship
between the enterprise strategy and IT strategy of XYZ
ACO and was provided to the team as part of the
architecture approach.  It represents an iterative process to
ensure the agile development of the EA specification that is
efficient and adaptive to business needs. The focus in the
project was on the Information/ Business Systems
Architecture Stage and the Architecture Stage. The team
project sponsor provided some input regarding the
enterprise and IT strategies of XYX ACO to give context to
the EA initiative.  This agile process model, informed by the
Agile Manifesto (Beck et al., 2013), was of particular value
in the project since the time constraints of the project were
finite. The four core values of agile process models and
supporting methodologies are: 1. Stakeholders and their
interactions have priority over processes and tools; 2.
Working software, in projects of this kind the prototypes,
are regarded as of more value than comprehensive
documentation; 3. Customer collaboration, in this case the
project sponsor, was of essential value; and 4. The project
plan was used as a living document and updated as the
project progressed. The main principles of Lean
Development as described by Poppendieck (2007) were
incorporated, including elimination of redundant work,
focus on quality, continuous learning, mutual respect of
stakeholders and team members, adherence to the project
plan to deliver specific project deliverables, and always
aiming to integrate the artifacts (of deliverables) into an
integrated whole.
3.4 Architecture Methodology
Along with the architecture process model, the lean
architecture methodology provided detailed steps and
guidelines to be followed in the process model stages and
phases, as well as specific deliverables for this team project.
As mentioned a selection of the models developed in this
project are given in the Teaching Case Notes supporting this
paper.
The steps of the methodology are given in Table 5,
along with the required artifacts to be developed and the
main team assignments (TAs) resulting from executing the
steps of the methodology. Each team member was
responsible for models relating to the assigned viewpoint,
and team members collaborated to develop artifacts of
mutual interest.

3.5 Tool environment
The project team used the following tools to accomplish this
project:
•
 Microsoft Project to create the project plan, define
the schedule, the work -breakdown-structure, assign
resources and monitor resource usage;
• Microsoft Visio to develop the use cases;
• OpenText ProVision Workbench for developi ng the
architecture models;
• Microsoft Excel to create the budget estimation, and
manage cost to budget allocations;
• Microsoft Word For project documentation;
• Blackboard/WIMBA and Skype for online meetings
of the project team.

4. MODELS

This section summarizes the models developed by team
members as home assignments. A selection of models
developed by the team when following the architecture
process model of Figure 3 for each viewpoint, is included in
this paper as appropriate, and some others are provided in
the Teaching Case Notes accompanying the paper. The
models vary in level of detail and type, such as conceptual,
logical and physical. A conceptual model is an abstract
rendering of a view, whereas a logical model provides more
generic static and behavioral data needed to implement the
model in reality. A physical model includes decisions about
software and hardware systems and related infrastructure of
an implementation, and represents the intended reality. The
analysis of the project charter and teamwork requirements
for the architecture initiative enabled the team to fully
populate the meta-architecture framework (refer Teaching
Case Table 3. Schema of Meta-Architecture Framework),
and a selection of these models, developed by the team in
the architecture stages and phases, are indicated in the
populated architecture framework in Teaching Case Notes,
Table 1. To facilitate referencing in this Teaching Case and
supporting Teaching Case Notes, Table 6 below provides
the partial architecture framework showing the first three
columns (of Teaching Case Notes,  Table 1), i.e. the
viewpoint, model portfolios and views/model types. Figures
and tables in bold are actually shown in either the Teaching
Case paper or the supporting Teaching Case Notes. As
mentioned the viewpoints of interest in this team project
were Enterprise, Information, Business System, Data,
Application and Enterprise Security viewpoints. It must be
noted that other viewpoints would also be needed but were
not addressed due to team size and time constraints, and are
by no means of lesser importance.

4.1 Enterprise Viewpoint Models
Enterprise Viewpoint models provide the context of the EA
initiative, the strategies, concerns and principles of XYZ
ACO. Table 6 lists the models developed by the team,
included in this paper and in the supporting Teaching Case
Notes: Teaching Case Notes Table 3 (1.1) XYZ ACO
Business Strategy, and Teaching Case Notes Figure 2 (5.1)
XYZ ACO Value Chains. The XYZ ACO Performance
Matrix (Table 2) presented in this paper, summarizes the
performance analysis of the EA initiative for XYZ ACO in
terms of goals and measures at three levels, namely the
Organization Level (strategic), the Process Level (tactical)
and Activity Level (operational). The XYZ ACO business
strategy is stated in the Teaching Case Study Notes, Table 3.

4.2 Information Viewpoint
This section contains the models for the Information
Architecture viewpoint. The Information Architecture
represents the information required by the processes and
activities performed within the XYZ ACO. The architecture
describes the interdependencies, connections and
relationships of information entities. Teaching Case Notes
Figure 3 gives the Hierarchy of Information Requirements
of this initiative summarized into three categories, namely
strategic, tactical, and operational information. The figure
shows a systemic structure of information requirements for
the entire enterprise, since effective information analysis
should consider all levels of the business in order to obtain
comprehensive information architecture for the enterprise as
described by Perks & Beveridge (2003).

4.3 Business Systems Viewpoint
The business systems viewpoint comprises the business
processes, systems, and other resources that are used to
perform XYZ ACO’s operational activities. Release 1 of the
new EA addressed Service Performance Management
capability and Patient Appointment Scheduling, defining
the scope of the project. The business systems viewpoint
was guided by two core principles namely Quality and
Accountability. Adherence to the other principles was
required for all viewpoints of architecture specifications.
Table 6. Partial Architecture Framework
Journal of Information Systems Education, Vol. 24(2) Summer 2013
115
![Page 11, Figure 1](subjects/Ggo/T4. Recursos. Arquitectura empresarial/Practica AE 2024/Teaching case EA specification Case study-images/Teaching case EA specification Case study_page_011.png)

### Page 12
Models for this viewpoint include the XYZ ACO Business
Capability Map in Figure 1, which highlights some key
capabilities to be leveraged in realizing the stated enterprise
strategy. Other models for this viewpoint include the XYZ
ACO Business Context Diagram in Figure 2, Patient
Appointment Manager System (Teaching Case Notes,
Figure 5.9) and Physician Performance Reporting System
(Teaching Case Notes, Figure 5.10).

4.4 Data Viewpoint
Data is the most valuable asset of an organization, and may
be aggregated, analyzed, and acted upon to deliver
meaningful information. XYZ ACO has recognized the
need for accurate and reliable data for accountable care and
the key principles of share ability, accessibility, and security.
A comprehe
nsive data analysis of this viewpoint was done
to identify the XYZ ACO organizations that create, read,
update, and delete data from each of the data entities, and
resulted in the partial CRUD Matrix (Teaching Case Notes,
Table 5. The CRUD Matrix provides a list of data entities
and the business systems that access the data based on the
requirement, i.e. (C) create, (R) review, (U) update, and (D)
delete. It also includes a Conceptual Data Model of XYZ
ACO (Teaching Case Notes, Figure 8, containing the main
classes along with their attributes and data types. The
relationships among classes are governed by the share
ability and accessibility principles.

4.5 Application Viewpoint
Models of relevance to Release 1 of the EA Initiative were
developed by the team and include the Service Performance
Reporting System which forms part of Service Performance
Management, and the Patient Appointment Manager System.
The application architecture to realize the Service
Performance Management capability shown in Figure 1
addresses concerns pertinent to assessing PCPs/Specialists
work and their quality of service provided to patients treated
at XYZ hospital. This principally includes reporting on their
daily, weekly and monthly work schedule, medical
procedures performed, and patients’ review of health care
service received during visits and/or treatment at XYZ
hospital.

4.6 Enterprise Security Viewpoint
The requirements of the XYZ ACO Enterprise Security
Architecture is holistic and encompass all security-related
concerns of the EA initiative, including physical, data,
information, application, and infrastructure security. This
means that the security architecture viewpoint is regarded as
a composite viewpoint requiring models in all viewpoints.
In addition, other security related concerns deal with:
•
 Corporate governance, including the security
compliance to information security policy and procedures.
• Security management on the strategic, ta ctical and
operational level.
• Legal, ethical and social concerns pertaining to
information security.
• Human resources concerns relating to all people
directly and indirectly, such as the security culture, security
awareness and training.
• Security of physical facilities including all the
resources needed to house and protect IT systems in the
organization (e.g. physical access control and security
doors).
Among the models developed for this viewpoint are
Composite Enterprise Security Diagram (Teaching Case
Notes, Figure 11), High Level Security Model (Teaching
Case Notes, Figure 12) and Organizational Levels of
Information Security Management (Teaching Case Notes,
Figure 13).

5. DISCUSSION

A selection of artifacts developed and used in the team
project is included in this Teaching Case paper. Some
supporting models also developed by the project team are
given in the Teaching Case Notes. Feedback on the course
design and integration of a team project into the course has
been positive. For their Course Reflection students reported
that their exposure to theory and practice of enterprise
architecture adequately prepared them for the course
assignments. In particular the coverage of technology,
representation schemes, notations, and tools available to
model the behavior and structure of target architectures
prepared them for the team assignments.
In the individual assignments, completed early in the
course, students found it stimulating to analyze a business
problem of their own choice and propose an IT enablement
intuitive with EA focus, and that it enhanced their problem
solving skills. Students’ feedback regarding the team project
component of the course included a number of points:
• the benef icial experience of learning -to-use while
applying their theoretical knowledge to the XYZ ACO
business case;
• team members’ varying academic and experiential
backgrounds were complementary, challenging them to
collaborate efficiently in areas of individu al competence,
while also sharing and integrating the deliverables of their
assigned tasks into the architecture design document;
• team members were equipped to work
independently on their architecture viewpoint as assigned in
project;
• collaboration among team members was a positive
learning experience;
• the tools provided in the course to develop
architecture models were very useful;
• collaboration was facilitated by the file exchange
capability in BB helped team members to exchange files
efficiently; color coding used to differentiate the team
members’ contributions was very helpful when multiple
team members are working and modifying the same
document;
• The team project provided an understanding of the
different viewpoints of the EA. How these vi ewpoints
interact, interrelate and complement each other is something
that would have been hard to understand without this team
project;
• It became clear what the value of IT enablement
and the EA are to an enterprise;
Student feedback also raised some issues they
experienced, such as:
Journal of Information Systems Education, Vol. 24(2) Summer 2013
116
![Page 12, Figure 1](subjects/Ggo/T4. Recursos. Arquitectura empresarial/Practica AE 2024/Teaching case EA specification Case study-images/Teaching case EA specification Case study_page_012.png)

### Page 13
• Different levels of performance of team members at
times resulted in project delays, and reduced other team
members’ motivation and quality of the final outcome;
• Experimenting with a tool such as Google Docs
could have been better
• It was hard to integrate artifacts into a consistent
and coherent architecture design document; there were
duplications and other redundancies, inconsistent
terminology and naming of figures and tables, and similar
issues;
• While peer reviewing of team members’  artifacts to
ensure quality control was time consuming, but at the same
time afforded the opportunity to review and comment on
each others’ work;
•
 Some students felt the insufficient number of face -
to-face meetings and that the virt ual meeting technology,
Wimba, was not as good as they needed;
• Some students would have preferred to have the
team project start earlier in the term, so that there would be
more time to integrate the multiple models, deliver quality
deliverables, and develop a prototype of the target system;
•
 Team members needed more involvement of the
project sponsor, and only later in the project understood the
importance of reaching out for support.
From the faculty perspective this team project
experience also demonstrated how a culturally diverse
group of students, faculty and sponsor, representing six
nationalities, can work effectively on a team project. The
project emphasized the need for a sound foundation in IT
systems, project management and supporting tools, and
affirmed that specific prerequisite knowledge and
experience are needed before allowing students to register
for this type of course. It is just too time-consuming to tutor
team members in areas of lacking knowledge and skills
once the team project has started and also causes frustration
among other well prepared team members.  It was important
to complement the on-ground class sessions with team
tutorials during which specific issues and problems were
discussed and addressed. Reviewing and grading team
project deliverables represent a considerable investment of
faculty’s time, but the value of meaningful feedback to team
members cannot be overstated.  The challenges of managing
a team project of this nature should not be under estimated.
This project is another example of the benefits of having a
course where students apply theoretical knowledge to a
problem of practice, learning by doing, and the importance
of virtual collaboration tools when collaborating in a hybrid
mode, i.e. face- to-face in-class and virtual communication
among team members.
